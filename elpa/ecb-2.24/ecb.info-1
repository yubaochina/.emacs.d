This is the user manual for ECB version 2.24.

ECB stands for "Emacs Code Browser".  While (X)Emacs already has good
*editing* support for many modes, its *browsing* support is somewhat
lacking.  That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of
informational windows that allow for easy source code navigation and
overview.

The informational windows can contain:

   * A directory tree,
   * a list of source files in the current directory,
   * a list of functions/classes/methods/...  in the current file, (ECB
     uses the Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this
     list so all languages supported by any of these tools are
     automatically supported by ECB too)
   * a history of recently visited files,
   * the Speedbar and
   * output from compilation (the "*compilation*" window) and other
     modes like help, grep etc.  or whatever a user defines to be
     displayed in this window.

As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows
visible, even when you use 'C-x 1' and similar commands.

It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie which
informational windows should be displayed where.  ECB comes with a
number of ready-made window layouts to choose from.

of all commands and user-options in *note Interactive ECB commands:: and

1.1 Installation of ECB
=======================

This section describes how to install ECB.

* Menu:

* XEmacs Installation::         Installation of ECB for XEmacs users
* GNU Emacs Installation::      Installation of ECB for GNU Emacs users


File: ecb.info,  Node: XEmacs Installation,  Next: GNU Emacs Installation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

1.1.1 Installation of ECB for XEmacs users
------------------------------------------

For XEmacs-users it is strongly recommended to use the
package-management-system of XEmacs for first-time
downloading/installing ECB or for upgrading to a newer version of ECB.
Here is a short guide (for details about the package-manager of XEmacs
see the related info-manual):

*Caution*: If ECB is already installed and you just want upgrading to a
newer version then it is recommended to deactivate ECB before proceeding
with the steps below!

  1. Choose a download-site

     This can be done via the menu "Tools -> Packages -> Add Download
     Site": Choose one of the listed sites.  Or you can customize the
     option 'package-get-remote' by hand and save it for future
     sessions.

  2. Activate the packages list

     This can be done either by the menu "Tools -> Packages -> List and
     Install" or via the command 'pui-list-packages'.  After that a
     special packages-buffer is displayed where you can interactively
     install or upgrade packages.  At the end of this buffer there is a
     short description how to use this buffer.

  3. Install ECB and all required packages

     Mark the package named "ecb" for install.  Do this also for the
     required packages "semantic", "eieio" and "speedbar".  The package
     "mail-lib" is needed for easy submitting of problem-reports to the
     ECB-maintainers and the package "c-support" is needed for easy
     using hideshow within the Methods-buffer of ECB(1).

     After marking all needed packages for installation hit 'x' to
     install them.

     If you have already installed ECB and you want just upgrading to
     the latest available version then proceed as described above - same
     if you want to upgrade one of the required packages.

  4. Start ECB

     Now you can immediately start ECB via the command 'ecb-activate';
     there is no need to restart XEmacs!  As an alternative you can
     first read the online-help via 'ecb-show-help'.

If you do not like the package-manager of XEmacs but you want installing
ECB "by hand" direct from the ECB-website then you have to follow the
instructions for GNU Emacs, see *note GNU Emacs Installation::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) All required packages can simply autom.  marked by hitting 'r' in
the packages buffer.  But this installs a lot of packages more (e.g.
the Newsreader Gnus) which are really not essential for ECB. Therefore
it is recommended to mark the required packages by hand.


File: ecb.info,  Node: GNU Emacs Installation,  Prev: XEmacs Installation,  Up: Installation

1.1.2 Installation of ECB for GNU Emacs users
---------------------------------------------

*IMPORTANT*: If you are a XEmacs-user please read *note XEmacs
Installation:: before proceeding with the following instructions!

*Using the new cedet 1.0 suite*: From beginning with version 2.01 ECB
supports the next generation of the cedet-tools.  But before the cedet
1.0 suite becomes stable this means that ECB runs correctly with loaded
cedet 1.0 but the ECB-upgrading feature (*note Downloading new
versions::) does not support autom.  upgrading to latest available cedet
versions.  This will be first available after first stable release of
the new cedet-library 1.0.

So, if the cedet 1.0 suite is loaded then the min- and max-version of
semantic, eieio and speedbar (mentioned in the Requirements-section of
the file 'README') have no relevance!  If the new cedet 1.0 suite should
be used then just install and load cedet 1.0 like described in the
cedet-installation-instructions and go one with step 3.

  1. Download and unpack the ECB archive (probably you have already done
     this :-)

  2. Read the file 'README' in the ECB-directory and install the
     required semantic-, eieio- and speedbar-version(1).

     *Please note*: ECB maybe requires a newer version of these
     libraries than shipped with (X)Emacs.  You have to install exactly
     a version ECB requires and also to make sure that the correct
     version is loaded into (X)Emacs!

     But ECB performs two autom checks:

        - At load-time: It checks if the packages semantic, eieio and
          speedbar are at least installed so ECB can be loaded.  If not
          it offers to download and install them.

        - At start-time: It checks if the correct versions of semantic,
          eieio and speedbar are installed and gives you proper
          feedback.  *Note Download required packages::.

     So if you are not sure if you have installed the required packages
     at all or if you have installed the correct versions of these
     packages then do not worry about this, just go on with the
     following installation steps: If ECB is missing something it will
     give you proper feedback and support not later than at load-time or
     start-time!

  3. Add the new ECB-directory to your 'load-path' variable.

     You *MUST* add the ECB-install-directory to the 'load-path' either
     by changing the 'load-path' variable directly in your '.emacs' or
     'site-lisp/site-start.el' or by working with a file
     'subdirs.el'(2).

     So for example the needed entry for your '.emacs'-file could be:

          (add-to-list 'load-path
                       "/path/to/your/ecb/installation/directory")

     *ATTENTION*: ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is not
     added to 'load-path' and for example just loaded by

          (load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")

     Do not do this!

  4. Load ECB by adding code to your '.emacs':

     If you want to load the complete ECB at (X)Emacs-loadtime
     (Advantage: All ECB-options available after loading ECB.
     Disadvantage: Increasing loadtime(3)):

          (require 'ecb)

     If you want to load the ECB first after starting it by
     'ecb-activate' (Advantage: Fast loading(4).  Disadvantage: ECB- and
     semantic-options first available after starting ECB):

          (require 'ecb-autoloads)

     This loads all available autoloads of ECB, e.g.  'ecb-activate',
     'ecb-minor-mode', 'ecb-byte-compile' and 'ecb-show-help'.

     Regardless which method you prefer: In both cases the used
     statement must be placed *after* the statement of step 3!

  5. Restart (X)Emacs.

ECB is now ready for use and can be activated by calling 'M-x
ecb-activate' or 'ecb-minor-mode'.  Now you can either starting using
ECB or you can do these optional installation steps:

  6. Reading the online help with 'ecb-show-help'

     Maybe you are interested to read the online-help of ECB before
     first start.

  7. Bytecompiling ECB with 'ecb-byte-compile'

     This byte compiles ECB. You can safely ignore all messages if there
     are any.  (You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line
     either by using the 'Makefile' or by using the batch-file
     'make.bat'; just read the comments in that file you choose.)

  8. Installing the Info-help of ECB

     The ECB distribution contains a subdirectory 'info-help' which
     contains the online-help of ECB in Info-format.  You can install
     this online help so it's available in the Top-directory of Info.
     There are two ways to do this:

        - Use "install-info" (recommended):

            1. Copy the files of the subdirectory 'info-help' into the
               info-directory of Emacs

            2. Install the file 'info-help/ecb.info' with the command
               "install-info" (if available on your system) in the
               'dir'-file.

          The supplied 'Makefile' offers a target 'install-help' which
          does both of these steps.  You have just to call 'make
          install-help' with the correct EMACSINFOPATH set (see the
          comment in 'Makefile').  Here is an example:

               make EMACSINFOPATH=/path/to/emacs/info install-help

        - Manual Installation:

          Copy the files of the subdirectory 'info-help' into the
          info-directory of Emacs and modify the file 'dir' manually.

     But it doesn't matter if you do not execute this step (8.)  because
     the online help of ECB is always available though, see
     'ecb-show-help' (*note Interactive ECB commands::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The speedbar-version shipped with GNU Emacs <= 21.3 does not
satisfy the requirements for this feature - download a newer one!

   (2) This works at least for Emacs 20.X and Emacs 21.X but XEmacs may
have slightly different mechanisms; see the XEmacs documentation

   (3) Cause of full loading of ECB itself and also the packages
semantic, eieio and speedbar regardless if ECB is started.

   (4) ECB, semantic, eieio and speedbar are first loaded after starting
ECB or with other words: ECB and semantic are not loaded if you do not
use/need them

1.2 How to set up Emacs for file parsing with ECB
=================================================

File: ecb.info,  Node: General hints,  Next: Setting up semantic,  Prev: Setting up Emacs,  Up: Setting up Emacs

1.2.1 General hints for a correct setup
---------------------------------------

ECB is for browsing files and therefore you have to setup your
Emacs-configuration properly so the file-parsing engines like semantic,
imenu or etags can be activated automatically for parsing your
Emacs-Lisp, C, C++ or Java buffers(1).  For this Emacs must activate the
correct 'major-mode' for the source-files and Emacs can only do this if
the option 'auto-mode-alist' is setup correctly.  The correct
major-modes and possible file-extensions(2) are:

LANGUAGE       MAJOR-MODE                           EXTENSION(S)
                                                    
Emacs Lisp     'emacs-lisp-mode'                    .el
                                                    
C              'c-mode'                             .h, .c
                                                    
C++            'c++-mode'                           .h, .hxx, .hh, .HH,
                                                    .cxx, .cpp, .cc, .CC
                                                    
Java           'java-mode' or 'jde-mode' (if you    .java
               use JDEE)

Example: If you want files with extension ".cpp" being c++-parsed by
semantic and ECB, your 'auto-mode-alist' must contain an entry like:

     ("\\.cpp\\'" . c++-mode)

After this ECB will correctly parse your ".cpp"-sources and display all
the parsing information in the ECB-methods buffer.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) semantic supports some more "languages" like Makefiles etc.  but
these are the most important ones.

   (2) Especially for C++ and C you can use any extension you want but
these are the most common ones!

1.2.2 Setting up semantic
-------------------------

To ensure ECB and semantic are working correctly for all by semantic
supported languages you have to pay attention to the following aspects
concerning your Emacs-setup:

  1. Setting up semantic itself

     For all semantic-supported file-types parsing files is done
     completely by semantic.  ECB just displays the parsing results.
     For all needs of ECB semantic is completely setup by ECB itself,
     i.e.  ECB sets up semantic for you!  You have only to add the
     installation directory of semantic to your 'load-path' (in an
     appropriate way)!

     *Please note*: If you setup semantic for yourself following the
     recommendations in the installation instructions of semantic then
     you have probably added code to your startup-file like:

          (setq semantic-load-turn-everything-on t)
          (require 'semantic-load)

     Be aware that this also enables the minor-modes
     'semantic-show-dirty-mode' and
     'semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode' where the former one
     highlights all code which has to be reparsed with dark background
     (which results in large portions of dark background ;-) and the
     latter one underlines all syntax which can not be parsed.
     Especially the former one can be really annoying.

     To switch off these modes you can add to your startup-file:

          (global-semantic-show-dirty-mode -1)
          (global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode -1)

  2. Checking your hooks

     If you have already checked point (1.)  and if you have still
     problems getting ECB/semantic working properly for your sources you
     should check the related major-mode hook.  Every major-mode X has a
     hook with name "X-hook" which is evaluated after activating the
     major-mode (see above, 2.), e.g.  the hook for the major-mode
     'c++-mode' is 'c++-mode-hook'.

     Semantic adds automatically during load-time a special
     "semantic-setup" to these major-mode hooks(1) in form of a
     "setup-function".  Example: For c and c++ modes semantic adds
     'semantic-default-c-setup' to 'c-mode-hook' and 'c++-mode-hook'.

     If your own Emacs-setup (e.g.  in '.emacs' or
     'site-lisp/site-start.el') overwrites such a major-mode-hook then
     semantic can not be activated for this major-mode and in
     consequence ECB can not work properly too!

     Check if your Emacs-setup uses somewhere 'setq' for adding code to
     a major-mode-hook.  *IMPORTANT*: Use 'add-hook' instead of
     'setq'(2)!

If your source-files are "running" with correct 'major-mode' and correct
major-mode hooks ECB and semantic will do what you expect them doing!

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Of course only for major-modes supported by semantic!

   (2) 'setq' replaces/overwrites the current value of a hook with the
new value whereas 'add-hook' *adds* the new value to the old-value of
the hook!

1.2.3 Setup for file types not supported by semantic
----------------------------------------------------

From version 1.94 on ECB supports also parsing and displaying
file-contents for file-types not supported by semantic (i.e.  there is
no semantic-grammar available for such file-types).

Such non-semantic file-types can often be parsed by imenu and/or etags.
Both of these parsing methods are now supported: ECB can display the
results of imenu and/or etags in its Method-buffer.  ECB uses for this
speedbar-logic.  Therefore the following speedbar options takes effect
for this feature:

   - 'speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list'
   - 'speedbar-tag-split-minimum-length'
   - 'speedbar-tag-regroup-maximum-length'
   - 'speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method'

Normally there should no need for you to bother with these options,
because the default values are suitable for most situations!  But if you
are not satisfied with the parsing/display results then you can change
some of these options.

1.3 First steps after activating ECB first time
===============================================

This section of the ECB online-help is displayed automatically by ECB
after activating ECB first time and describes what are the first basic
steps:

  1. Configure where ECB can find your sources:

     Call 'M-x customize-option RET ecb-source-path RET'(1).  This lets
     you customize the option 'ecb-source-path' with the
     customize-feature of Emacs.  This opens a customize-buffer where
     you can insert all the directories where ECB can find your
     source-files.  Save your changes with the button "Save for future
     sessions" and then throw away this customize-buffer either by
     killing it with 'M-x kill-buffer' or clicking at the button
     "Finish".

  2. Take a look at the most important options of ECB Call 'M-x
     ecb-customize-most-important RET' and see a list of options which
     you should at least know that these options exist.

  3. Read the online-help of ECB:

     The online-help of ECB is available via

        - calling 'M-x ecb-show-help',
        - pressing 'C-c . o' or
        - using the menu "ECB".

     (The section you are currently reading is part of the online-help
     of ECB)

     Here is also the chapter "Tips and tricks" very interesting!

  4. Start working with ECB.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This means first hitting the keys 'M' (Meta- or Alt-key) and 'x'
simultaneously, inserting "customize-option" in the minibuffer, hitting
RETURN, inserting "ecb-source-path" in the minibuffer and finally
hitting RETURN again

2 Overview
**********

ECB is a global minor-mode which offers a couple of "ECB-windows" for
browsing your sources comfortable with the mouse and the keyboard.
These "special" windows are also called "tree-buffer" in this manual.
Every "item" in such a tree-buffer, i.e.  every line, is also called a
"node" of this tree-buffer.  See *note Tree-buffer styles:: to get an
impression about the look&feel of these tree-buffers.  There are
currently three different types of ECB-windows/tree-buffers:

   - ECB-Directories
   - ECB-Sources
   - ECB-Methods

In addition to these "special" ECB-windows you have always an
"edit-area" where you can edit sour source-files.  The edit-area can be
divided into several "edit-windows" - as many as you need (*note The
edit-area::).  And at the bottom of the ECB-frame a durable
"compilation-window" (also called "compile-window") can be displayed
(optional), where all the output of Emacs-compilation (compile, grep
etc.)  is shown (*note Temp- and compile-buffers::).

The following "ascii-screenshot" illustrates the typical layout of the
ECB-frame(1):

File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Directories-buffer,  Next: ECB Sources-buffer,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Overview

2.1 ECB Directories-buffer
==========================

   * Select directories (and - if enabled - source files) in the
     "ECB-Directories" buffer by clicking a mouse button on the
     directory name or by hitting RETURN when the cursor is placed on
     the item line, see *note Usage of ECB::.

     IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e.  hold down the
     SHIFT-key while clicking with the primary mouse button (*note Using
     the mouse::) or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)) on a directory
     node in the this buffer then the directory-contents-cache for this
     directory will be refreshed and actualized.

   * Directory names with a "[+]" symbol after (or before) them can be
     expanded/collapsed by clicking on the symbol, pressing the TAB key
     (*note Using the keyboard::) when the cursor is placed on the
     package line or clicking a mouse button on the item, see *note
     Using the mouse::.

   * Right clicking on an item will open a popup menu where different
     operations on the item under the mouse cursor can be performed.

   * Pressing F2 will open the ECB customization group (*note
     Customizing::) in the edit window.  F3 shows the online help in the
     edit-window.  Pressing F4 in the ECB-directories buffer will offer
     adding a new source-path.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Sources-buffer,  Next: ECB Methods-buffer,  Prev: ECB Directories-buffer,  Up: Overview

2.2 ECB Sources-buffer
======================

   * Source files can be selected by clicking with the primary mouse
     button (*note Using the mouse::) or hitting RETURN (*note Using the
     keyboard::) on the source row in the "ECB-Sources" or "ECB-History"
     windows.  The buffer of the selected source-file will be displayed
     in an edit-window - which one depends on the setting in
     'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

     IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e.  hold down the
     SHIFT-key while clicking with the primary mouse button (*note Using
     the mouse::) or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)) on a source
     row in the ECB-Sources or ECB-History windows then the source will
     not be displayed in an edit-window but it will be scanned in the
     background and all its contents (e.g.  methods and variables) are
     listed in the "ECB Methods" window (*note ECB Methods-buffer::.  So
     you can get an overlook over the source without changing the buffer
     in the edit-window.

   * Clicking on the source file with the secondary mouse button or
     C-RETURN (*note Usage of ECB::) will open the source file in
     another edit window - which one depends on the setting in
     'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   * Right clicking on a source file (mouse-button 3) will open a popup
     menu where different operation on the item under the mouse cursor
     can be performed.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Methods-buffer,  Prev: ECB Sources-buffer,  Up: Overview

2.3 ECB Methods-buffer
======================

The "ECB-Methods" buffer contains all parsed and recognized tags of the
current source-buffer.  It is called "Method-buffer" because ECB is
mostly designed for browsing sourcecode files and for
programming-languages these tags are often methods (and variables etc.)
To simplify explanations we talk in the following only about methods and
variables - but in general the method-buffer can contain any kind of
tags (e.g.  sections and subsections for texinfo buffers).

   * When a method/variable is selected with the primary mouse button
     (*note Using the mouse::) or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)
     the buffer in the edit-window (which one depends on the setting in
     'ecb-mouse-click-destination') will jump to the method/variable.

     IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e.  hold down the
     SHIFT-key while clicking with the primary mouse button (*note Using
     the mouse::) or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)) on a node in
     this buffer then the edit-buffer will be narrowed to the selected
     tag (see also option 'ecb-tag-visit-post-actions').  But this works
     only for sources parsed by semantic, not by imenu or etags!

   * Clicking on a method/variable with the secondary mouse button or
     C-RETURN (*note Usage of ECB::) will jump to the method in another
     edit window - which one depends on the setting in
     'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   * Right clicking on a method/variable will open a popup menu where
     different operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be
     performed.

3 Activation and Deactivation
*****************************

This chapter describes all aspects of activating and deactivating ECB.

* Menu:

* Standard activation::         How to manually (de)activate ECB
* Automatic activation::        Automatically (de)activating ECB

*IMPORTANT*: Regardless of the activation-type (standard or automatic)
the activation-process of ECB is always completely failure-save.  This
means any error during any step of the activation-process forces a
complete cleanup (e.g.  removing hooks, disabling advices etc.)  of all
settings ECB did (e.g.  adding hooks, activating advices etc.)  until
the failure.  Therefore if ECB-activation stops cause of a failure then
you can be sure that your Emacs has the same state as before the
ECB-activation-start!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Standard activation,  Next: Automatic activation,  Prev: Activation and Deactivation,  Up: Activation and Deactivation

3.1 Standard activation and deactivation
========================================

Call 'M-x ecb-activate' and 'M-x ecb-deactivate' to activate or
deactivate ECB(1). If you want ECB started in a new frame see the option
'ecb-new-ecb-frame' (default is nil).  'ecb-activate' always raises and
selects the ECB-frame even if ECB is already started.

Because ECB is a global minor-mode it can also be (de)activated/toggled
by 'M-x ecb-minor-mode'.

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during activation of ECB:
  1. 'ecb-before-activate-hook'
  2. <All actions for activation but no layout drawing>
  3. 'ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook'
  4. 'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'
  5. <Drawing the layout>
  6. 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
  7. 'ecb-activate-hook'

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during deactivation of ECB:
  1. 'ecb-before-deactivate-hook'
  2. <All actions for deactivation of ECB>
  3. 'ecb-deactivate-hook'

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Activation is also possible via the menu "Tools -> Start Code
Browser (ECB)".


File: ecb.info,  Node: Automatic activation,  Prev: Standard activation,  Up: Activation and Deactivation

3.2 Automatic activation and deactivation
=========================================

There are two ways for auto.  (de)activation ECB after Emacs-start and
for different window-configurations.

'ecb-auto-activate'
     This option is for auto.  activating ECB after Emacs-startup.  Set
     this to not nil and ECB will automatically be started after Emacs
     comes up.

'window-manager support'
     The window-manager support of ECB deactivates ECB when going to
     another window-configuration and reactivates ECB when coming back
     to the ECB-window-configuration.  For all details about this see
     *note Window-managers and ECB::.

4.1 Working with the mouse in the ECB-windows
=============================================

Normally you get best usage if you use ECB with a mouse.  ECB
distinguishes between a "primary" and a "secondary" mouse-button.

With the option 'ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons' the following
combinations of primary and secondary mouse-buttons are possible:

   - primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2(1).  This is the default.

   - primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1

   - primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2

If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
activate ECB again to take effect.

4.1.1 The primary mouse-button
------------------------------

A click with the primary button causes the main effect in each
ECB-buffer:

   - ECB Directories: Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files in
     the ECB-Sources buffer.

   - ECB sources/history: Opening the file in that edit-window specified
     by the option 'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   - ECB Methods: Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by
     the option 'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

4.1.2 The POWER- or SHIFT-click
-------------------------------

A click with the primary mouse-button while the SHIFT-key is pressed is
called the POWER-click and does the following (depending on the
ECB-buffer where the POWER-click occurs):

   - ECB Directory: Refreshing the directory-contents-cache (see
     'ecb-cache-directory-contents').

   - ECB sources/history: Only displaying the source-contents in the
     method-buffer but not displaying the source-file in an edit-window.
     This means it opens the clicked source only in the background and
     shows all its methods/variables in ECB-Methods; the buffer of the
     edit-window is not changed!  This is very useful to get only an
     overlook for a certain source.

   - ECB Methods: Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect...  (see
     'ecb-tag-visit-post-actions').  But this works only for sources
     parsed by semantic, not by imenu or etags!

Per default the complete node-name of an item in a tree-buffer is
displayed in the echo-area if the mouse moves over it, regardless if the
related window is the active one or not.  You get the same effect always
after a POWER-click.  In general: Via 'ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer'
you can specify in a detailed manner for every ECB tree-buffer when and
which node-info should be displayed in the minibuffer.

4.1.3 The secondary mouse-button
--------------------------------

The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in
another edit-window (see the documentation of the option
'ecb-mouse-click-destination').

4.1.4 The right mouse-button
----------------------------

In each ECB-buffer mouse-3 (= right button) opens a special context
popup-menu for the clicked item where you can choose several senseful
actions.

With the options 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension',
'ecb-sources-menu-user-extension', 'ecb-methods-menu-user-extension' and
'ecb-history-menu-user-extension' you can add statically new commands to
the popup-menus.  See the docstring of
'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension' for more details.

With the options 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension-function',
'ecb-sources-menu-user-extension-function',
'ecb-methods-menu-user-extension-function' and
'ecb-history-menu-user-extension-function' you can add new commands to
the popup-menus in a dynamic manner.  See the docstring of
'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension-function' for more details.

With the options 'ecb-directories-menu-sorter',
'ecb-sources-menu-sorter', 'ecb-methods-menu-sorter' and
'ecb-history-menu-sorter' you can even re-arrange all the entries of the
popup-menus.

4.1.5 Horizontal scrolling with the mouse
-----------------------------------------

In each tree-buffer of ECB you can easily scroll left and right with the
mouse if the option 'ecb-tree-easy-hor-scroll' is not 'nil'.

The reason for this is: XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible
parts beyond the right window-border of a tree-buffer can always made
visible very easy.

GNU Emacs does not have hor.  scroll-bars so especially with the mouse
it is quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left.  The functions
'scroll-left' and 'scroll-right' can be annoying and are also not bound
to mouse-buttons.

ECB offers three ways for smoothly hor.  scrolling with GNU Emacs if
'ecb-tree-easy-hor-scroll' is a positive integer-value S:

   * In all ECB-tree-buffers the keys 'M-mouse-1' and 'M-mouse-3' are
     bound to scrolling left rsp.  right with scroll-step S.

   * Clicking with mouse-1 or mouse-2 onto the edge of the modeline has
     the same effect, i.e.  if you click with mouse-1 onto the left
     \(resp right) edge of the modeline you will scroll left \(resp.
     right) with scroll-step S.

   * Additionally 'C-M-mouse-1' and 'C-M-mouse-3' are bound to scrolling
     left rsp.  right with scroll-step 'window-width' - 2.

This is NOT done for XEmacs cause of its horizontal scrollbars.  If you
want scrolling left and right with the mouse in XEmacs then activate the
horizontal scrollbars.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) means mouse-2 while CTRL-key is pressed.

4.2 Working with the keyboard in the ECB-windows
================================================

ECB offers the 'ecb-mode-map' which binds the most important functions
of ECB to keys so you can easily use ECB in every window(1) without a
mouse.

IMPORTANT: Do not modify 'ecb-mode-map' directly!  The option
'ecb-key-map' defines all ECB keybindings, including a common prefix-key
(This is by default 'C-c .').  If there are conflicts with other
minor-modes or packages you can define very easy another prefix.  Please
read carefully the description of 'ecb-key-map' (*note ecb-general::).!

The following sections describe special topics about using the keyboard
in the ECB-tree-buffers:

* Menu:

* Navigation/Selection::        Keyboard navigation/selection in a tree-buffer
* Incremental search::          Find nodes as fast as possible
* Personal keybindings::        Adding personal keybindings to a tree-buffer
* Using popup-menus::           Using the popup-menus from keyboard.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Regardless if a tree-window or an edit-window


File: ecb.info,  Node: Navigation/Selection,  Next: Incremental search,  Prev: Using the keyboard,  Up: Using the keyboard

4.2.1 Navigation and Selection in a tree-buffer
-----------------------------------------------

In the ECB-buffers RETURN and TAB are the most important keys:

   * RETURN does the same as the primary button and C-RETURN does the
     same as the secondary button.  S-RETURN is the same as the
     SHIFT-click or POWER-click.  The terms "primary", "secondary",
     "SHIFT-" and "POWER-click" are explained in *note Using the
     mouse::.  See also the option 'ecb-tree-RET-selects-edit-window'
     and the function 'ecb-toggle-RET-selects-edit-window' which is
     bound to 'C-t' in each tree-buffer of ECB!

   * TAB always expands or collapses expandable nodes.

The RETURN and TAB keys can not be (re)defined with 'ecb-key-map'!

If you set 'ecb-tree-navigation-by-arrow' to not nil then the left- and
right-arrow keys work in the ECB tree-window in the following smart way:

   * Left-arrow: If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise
     (i.e.  current node is either not expandable or not expanded) point
     jumps to the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree (higher
     means the next higher level or - if no higher level available - the
     next higher node on the same level).

   * Right-arrow: If node is expandable but not expanded then it will be
     expanded.  Otherwise (i.e.  current node is either not expandable
     or already expanded) point jumps to the next following node (which
     is the first subnode in case of an already expanded node or simply
     the next node in the following line).


File: ecb.info,  Node: Incremental search,  Next: Personal keybindings,  Prev: Navigation/Selection,  Up: Using the keyboard

4.2.2 Incremental search for a node in current tree-buffer
----------------------------------------------------------

Each display-able key (e.g.  all keys normally bound to
'self-insert-command') is appended to the current search-pattern.  The
tree-buffer tries to jump to the first node which matching the current
search-pattern either as substring or as prefix (see below).  If no
match is found then nothing is done.  There are some special keys:

   * 'backspace' and 'delete': Delete the last character from the
     search-pattern.

   * 'home': Delete the complete search-pattern

   * 'end': Expand either to a complete node if current search-pattern
     is already unique or expands to the greatest common substring or
     prefix of the nodes.  If there are at least two nodes with the same
     greatest common-prefix than every hit of 'end' jumps to the next
     node with this common prefix.

For better overlooking the current search-pattern is shown in the echo
area.  After selecting a node with RET the search-pattern is cleared
out.  With 'ecb-tree-incremental-search' you can specify if the current
search-pattern must be a real prefix of the node (default) or if any
substring is matched.

For faster and easier finding the right node in a ecb-window the
incremental search ignores the following non interesting stuff:

   - any leading spaces
   - expand/collapse-buttons: [+] rsp.  [-]
   - protection-signs (+, -, #) in the method-window if uml-notation is
     used
   - variables types or return-types in front of variable- or
     method-names.
   - const specifier for variables

This means: Just type in the prefix (rsp.  a substring) of a class-,
variable-, method-, directory- or filename and ECB will bring you as
fast as possible to the node you want.  Incremental node-search uses the
value of 'case-fold-search'.

Tip: The 'ecb-minor-mode' offers you in the 'ecb-mode-map' (customizable
via 'ecb-key-map') some keys for selecting every window of the
ecb-frame.  This makes window-selection a childs play.  For example you
can jump into the method-window by hitting 'C-c . gm'.

4.2.3 Adding personal keybindings
---------------------------------

There are five hooks which can be used for adding personal keybindings
to the ECB tree-buffers:

   - 'ecb-common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook'
   - 'ecb-directories-buffer-after-create-hook'
   - 'ecb-sources-buffer-after-create-hook'
   - 'ecb-methods-buffer-after-create-hook'
   - 'ecb-history-buffer-after-create-hook'

These hooks are called directly after tree-buffer creation so they can
be used to add personal local keybindings(1) either to all tree-buffers
('ecb-common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook') or just to a certain
tree-buffer.  Here is a list which keys MUST NOT be rebound:

   * 'RET' and all combinations with 'Shift' and 'Ctrl': Used for
     selecting nodes in all tree-buffers.
   * 'TAB': Used for expanding/collapsing nodes in all tree-buffers.
   * 'C-t': Used for toggling "jump after selection" in all
     tree-buffers, see command 'ecb-toggle-RET-selects-edit-window'.
   * All self-inserting characters: Used for easy and fast navigation in
     all tree-buffers, *Note Incremental search::.
   * 'F2', 'F3', 'F4': Used for customizing ECB, adding source-path in
     the directories buffer.

The following example binds 'C-a' to some useful code in ALL
tree-buffers and 'C-d' to even more useful code ONLY in the directories
buffer:

     (add-hook 'ecb-common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook
               (lambda ()
                  (local-set-key (kbd "C-a")
                                 (lambda ()
                                    (interactive)
                                    (message "ECB is great!")))))

     (add-hook 'ecb-directories-buffer-after-create-hook
               (lambda ()
                  (local-set-key (kbd "C-d")
                                 (lambda ()
                                    (interactive)
                                    (message "ECB is wonderful!")))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To be more general: They can be used to run any arbitrary lisp
code after a tree-buffer creation!

4.2.4 Using the popup-menu of a tree-buffer from keyboard.
----------------------------------------------------------

A popup-menu of a tree-buffer can be activated from keyboard with the
command 'tree-buffer-show-menu-keyboard' which is bound to 'M-m' in
every tree-buffer.  How the popup-menu is displayed depends if this
command is called with a prefix-argument or not:

If called without a prefix-arg then the popup-menu is displayed
graphically as if it would be activated via mouse (for GNU Emacs this
works perfectly but for XEmacs there is a bug which results in a wrong
menu-position - but the menu itself works also with XEmacs).

If called with a prefix-arg ('C-u M-m') then the popup-menu is displayed
with the tmm-mechanism (like the Emacs-[menu-bar] is displayed when
'tmm-menubar' is called).  This tmm-display is only available for GNU
Emacs.

4.3 Working with the edit-window(s) of the edit-area
====================================================

ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-area as if the
edit-windows of the edit-area would be the only windows of the
ECB-frame.

ECB offers you to advice the following functions so they work best with
ECB:

   - 'other-window'
   - 'delete-window'
   - 'delete-other-windows'
   - 'delete-windows-on'
   - 'split-window-horizontally'
   - 'split-window-vertically'
   - 'split-window'
   - 'display-buffer'
   - 'switch-to-buffer'
   - 'switch-to-buffer-other-window'
   - 'other-window-for-scrolling'
   - 'balance-windows'

The behavior of the adviced functions is (slightly simplified):

   * All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their
     corresponding original functions but they always act as if the
     edit-window(s) of ECB would be the only window(s) of the ECB-frame.
     So the edit-window(s) of ECB seems to be a normal Emacs-frame to
     the user.  This means that you can split and delete edit-windows
     without any restriction - ECB ensures that neither the special
     ECB-windows nor the compile-window will be damaged.

   * If there is a durable compile-window (*note Temp- and
     compile-buffers::) then all compilation-buffers in the sense of
     'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' will be displayed in the compile-window.

   * If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions
     behave exactly like the not adviced original versions!

ATTENTION: If you want to work within the edit-area with splitting and
unsplitting (i.e.  deleting) the edit-window(s) it is highly recommended
to use the adviced-functions of ECB instead of the original
Emacs-functions (see above).  Per default ECB advices all of the
functions mentioned above but with the option
'ecb-advice-window-functions' you can customizes which functions should
be adviced by ECB. Please read carefully the documentation of this
option!

Another interesting option in the context of the edit-window and these
adviced functions is 'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!

4.3.1 Documentation of the adviced window functions
---------------------------------------------------

This section describes for every adviced window function (s.a.)  how it
differs from the original version.  Only the differences are mentioned,
so if you want the full documentation of such a function call
'describe-function' or 'C-h f'.

 -- Command: other-window ARG &optional ALL-FRAMES
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'other-window'.  Works
     exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment: The behavior depends on
     'ecb-other-window-behavior'.

 -- Command: delete-window &optional WINDOW
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'delete-window'.  Works
     exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment:

     If optional argument WINDOW is nil (i.e.  probably called
     interactively): If called in a splitted edit-window then it works
     like as if all the edit-windows would be the only windows in the
     frame.  This means the current edit-window which contains the point
     will be destroyed and its place will be occupied from another one.
     If called in an unsplitted edit-window then nothing is done.  If
     called in the compile-window of ECB then the compile-window will be
     hidden (like with 'ecb-toggle-compile-window').  If called in an
     ecb-window of the current ECB-layout there are two alternatives:

        * If the function is contained in
          'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window' the right
          edit-window is selected (depends on the value of the option
          'ecb-mouse-click-destination') and does then its job.

        * Otherwise the behavior depends on the value of the option
          'ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

     If optional argument WINDOW is a living window (i.e.  called from
     program): If WINDOW is an edit-window then this window is deleted,
     if WINDOW is the compile-window then it will be hidden and
     otherwise the behavior depends on
     'ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

 -- Command: delete-other-windows &optional WINDOW
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'delete-other-windows'.
     Works exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment:

     If optional argument WINDOW is nil (i.e.  probably called
     interactively): If called in a splitted edit-window then it works
     like as if all the edit-windows would be the only windows in the
     frame.  This means all other edit-windows besides the current
     edit-window which contains the point will be destroyed and the
     current edit-window fills the whole edit-area.  Neither the special
     ecb-windows nor the compile-window will be destroyed!

        * If called in an unsplitted edit-window then either the
          compile-window will be hidden (if there is one) otherwise
          nothing is done.

        * If called in one of the ecb-windows then the current one is
          maximized, i.e.  the other ecb-windows (not the edit-windows!)
          are deleted.

        * If called in the compile window there are two alternatives:

             - If the function is contained in
               'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window' the right
               edit-window is selected (depends on the value of the
               option 'ecb-mouse-click-destination') and then it does
               its job.

             - Otherwise the behavior depends on the value of the option
               'ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

     If optional argument WINDOW is a living window (i.e.  called from
     program): If WINDOW is an edit-window then this window is maximized
     (i.e.  the other edit-window is deleted) if there are more at least
     2 edit-windows otherwise the compile-window is deleted (if there is
     one).  If WINDOW is an ecb-window then only the other ecb-windows
     are deleted and in all other cases the behavior depends on
     'ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

 -- Command: delete-windows-on BUFFER &optional FRAME
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'delete-windows-on'.  Works
     exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment:

     An error is reported if BUFFER is an ECB-tree-buffer.  These
     windows are not allowed to be deleted.

 -- Command: split-window &optional WINDOW SIZE HORFLAG
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'split-window'.  Works
     exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment:

     If called for a not-edit-window in the 'ecb-frame' it stops with an
     error if 'split-window' is not contained in the option
     'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!  Besides this (e.g.
     called for a window in another frame than the 'ecb-frame') it
     behaves like the original version.

 -- Command: split-window-horizontally
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of
     'split-window-horizontally'.  Works exactly like the original
     function with the following ECB-adjustment:

     If called in any other window of the current ECB-layout it stops
     with an error if this 'split-window-horizontally' is not contained
     in the option 'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!

 -- Command: split-window-vertically
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'split-window-vertically'.
     Works exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment:

     If called in any other window of the current ECB-layout it stops
     with an error if this 'split-window-vertically' is not contained in
     the option 'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!

 -- Command: display-buffer BUFFER &optional NOT-THIS-WINDOW FRAME
     Around-advice 'ecb': Makes this function compatible with ECB if
     called in or for the ecb-frame.  It displays all buffers which are
     "compilation-buffers" in the sense of 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' in
     the compile-window of ECB. If the compile-window is temporally
     hidden then it will be displayed first.

     If there is no compile-window ('ecb-compile-window-height' is nil)
     then it splits the edit-window if unsplitted and displays BUFFER in
     another edit-window but only if 'pop-up-windows' is not nil
     (otherwise the edit-window will not be splitted).

     All buffers which are not "compilation-buffers" in the sense of
     'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' will be displayed in one of the
     edit-area and 'display-buffer' behaves as if the edit-windows would
     be the only windows in the frame.

     If BUFFER is contained in 'special-display-buffer-names' or matches
     'special-display-regexps' then 'special-display-function' will be
     called (if not nil).  But this behavior depends on the value of the
     option 'ecb-ignore-special-display'.  The values of
     'same-window-buffer-names' and 'same-window-regexps' are supported
     as well.

     See the option 'ecb-ignore-display-buffer-function'!

     If called for other frames it works like the original version.

 -- Command: switch-to-buffer BUFFER &optional NORECORD
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of 'switch-to-buffer'.  Works
     exactly like the original but with the following enhancements for
     ECB:

     "compilation-buffers" in the sense of 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p'
     will be displayed always in the compile-window of ECB (if
     'ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil) - if the compile-window is
     temporally hidden then it will be displayed first.  If you do not
     want this you have to modify the options
     'ecb-compilation-buffer-names', 'ecb-compilation-major-modes' or
     'ecb-compilation-predicates'.

     If called for non "compilation-buffers" (s.a.)  from outside the
     edit-area of ECB it behaves as if called from an edit-window if
     'switch-to-buffer' is contained in the option
     'ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'.  Otherwise an error is
     reported.

 -- Command: switch-to-buffer-other-window BUFFER &optional FRAME
     Around-advice 'ecb': The ECB-version of
     'switch-to-buffer-other-window'.  Works exactly like the original
     but with some adaptions for ECB so this function works in a
     "natural" way:

     If called in any special ecb-window of the current ECB-layout then
     it goes always to an edit-window (which one depends on the setting
     in 'ecb-mouse-click-destination') and then goes on as if called
     from this edit-window.

     If a compile-window is used (i.e.  'ecb-compile-window-height' is
     not nil) then "compilation-buffers" in the sense of
     'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' are always displayed in the
     compile-window.  If the compile-window is temporally hidden then it
     will be displayed first.  If no compile-window is used it behaves
     like the original.

     If called from within the compile-window then "compilation-buffers"
     will be displayed still there and all other buffers are displayed
     in one of the edit-windows - if the destination-buffer is already
     displayed in one of the edit-windows then this one is used
     otherwise it behaves like the original.

     If called within an edit-window it behaves like the original
     function except for compilation-buffers (if a compile-window is
     used, see above).

 -- Function: other-window-for-scrolling
     Around-advice 'ecb': This function determines the window which is
     scrolled if any of the "other-window-scrolling-functions" is called
     (e.g.  'scroll-other-window'):

     If the option 'ecb-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile-window' is
     not nil (maybe set by
     'ecb-toggle-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile') and a
     compile-window is visible then always the current buffer in the
     compile-window is scrolled!

     Otherwise it depends completely on the setting in
     'ecb-other-window-behavior'.

 -- Command: balance-windows
     Around-advice 'ecb': When called in the 'ecb-frame' then only the
     edit-windows are balanced.

4.4 Temp- and compile-buffers display in ECB
============================================

If you call any help in Emacs, e.g.  by calling 'describe-function', or
if you do a completion in the minibuffer, then Emacs displays the
result-buffer in another window.  This behavior you have also in ECB.

4.4.1 Standard Emacs behavior
-----------------------------

If the edit-area is already splitted into at least two edit-windows then
the temp-buffer is displayed in another edit-window otherwise the
edit-are will be splitted first into two edit-windows, one above the
other.  The variables 'temp-buffer-max-height' and
'temp-buffer-resize-mode' (the latter one does not exist in XEmacs) work
also correctly with ECB.

Same for all compilation output-buffers (e.g.  after a 'compile' or
'grep') and the variable 'compilation-window-height'.

This is default behavior of ECB. But there is also another way to
display such buffers: Using a durable extra window at the bottom of the
ECB-frame:

4.4.2 Using a durable compile window
------------------------------------

With the option 'ecb-compile-window-height' you can define if the ECB
layout should contain per default a compile-window at the bottom (just
specify the number of lines which should be used for the compile-window
at the bottom of the frame).  If "yes" ECB displays all buffers for
which the function 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil (e.g.  all
output of compilation-mode (compile, grep etc.)  or all temp-buffers
like *Help*-buffers) in this special window.

In general: With the options 'ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
'ecb-compilation-major-modes' and 'ecb-compilation-predicates' you can
define which buffers should be displayed in the compile-window of ECB
(for example if you call 'switch-to-buffer' or 'display-buffer' or if
you run 'compile' or if you display *Help*-buffers).  Per default these
are all temp-buffers like *Help*-buffers, all compile- and grep buffers,
*Occur*-buffers etc.  See the default values of these options.

With the command 'ecb-toggle-compile-window' (bound to 'C-c . \') you
can toggle the visibility of the compile-window (*note Interactive ECB
commands::).

There are some more useful options and commands related to the
compile-window of ECB (to see all options for the compile-window see the
customization group *note ecb-compilation::):

   * With the option 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' you can
     allow Emacs to enlarge temporally the ECB-compile-window in some
     situations.  Please read the comment of this option.  See also the
     description of the command 'ecb-toggle-compile-window-height'.

   * With the option 'ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height' you
     specify how 'ecb-toggle-compile-window-height' should enlarge the
     compile-window.

   * With the command 'ecb-cycle-through-compilation-buffers' (*note
     Interactive ECB commands::) you can cycle through all current open
     compilation-buffers (in the sense of 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p')
     very fast.

ECB offers the same compile-window functionality regardless if the
ECB-window are hidden or not.  The state of the compile-window will be
preserved when toggling the ecb-windows or when maximizing one
ecb-windows!  So you have the advantage of one special window for all
help-, grep or compile-output (see above) also when the ecb-windows are
hidden - a window which will not be deleted if you call
'delete-other-windows' (bound to 'C-x 1') for one of the edit-windows.
In general: All features of the compile-window work with hidden
ecb-windows exactly as when the ecb-windows are visible.

4.4.3 What to do if there are problems with the compile-window
--------------------------------------------------------------

Normally displaying temp- and compilation-buffers (or more general:
displaying buffer for which 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' is not nil)
should work reliable.  But if there are problems which you can not
handle with the options 'ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
'ecb-compilation-major-modes' or 'ecb-compilation-predicates' then
please go on like follows:

  1. Set the option 'ecb-layout-debug-mode' to not nil.

  2. Reproduce the wrong behavior exactly by repeating all the
     operations which lead to the problem.  If possible then restart
     Emacs before reproducing the problem so you can begin from the
     beginning!

  3. Now send immediately a bug report with 'ecb-submit-problem-report'.

  4. Set 'ecb-layout-debug-mode' back to nil if you do not want further
     debugging output in the *Messages* buffer"

4.4.4 Handling special-display-buffers
--------------------------------------

Emacs offers three options for a special-display-handling of certain
buffers: 'special-display-function', 'special-display-buffer-names' and
'special-display-regexps' (see the Emacs manual for a description of
these options).  ECB offers an option 'ecb-ignore-special-display' for
specification in which situations ECB should take account for the values
of these special-display-options.

Default-behavior of ECB is to ignore these special-display-options when
a durable compile-window is active (i.e.  'ecb-compile-window-height' is
not nil).  But with 'ecb-ignore-special-display' you can tell ECB, that
either always the special-display-options should be ignored as long as
ECB is active or that they should be never igored regardless if a
durable compile-window is set or not.  In the latter case using
'display-buffer' or 'pop-to-buffer' takes always account for the values
of these options - like the original behavior of Emacs.

4.5 How the "other window" is determined by ECB
===============================================

Normally all windows in an Emacs-frame are arranged in a cyclic order
and window-selecting-commands like 'other-window' or
window-scrolling-commands like 'scroll-other-window' choose simply the
next(1) window after the current window as "other window".

4.5.1 "Other window"-basics in ECB
----------------------------------

With a typical window-layout of ECB such a cyclic order of *all* windows
in the ECB-frame does not make sense because it would be not very
intuitive and against that what the user wants to "say" when calling
'other-window' or 'scroll-other-window'.

Therefore ECB divides the whole set of windows of the ECB-frame in
several subsets:

   * The edit-windows of the edit-area
   * The special tree-windows for browsing-tasks
   * The compile-window at the bottom (if there is one)
   * The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame (if active)

Each of these subsets will be treated as a cyclic ordered subset, i.e.
all windows in each of these subsets are ordered as the function
'walk-windows' would visit the windows when the windows of a subset
would be the only windows of a frame(2).

4.5.2 Builtin "other window" behaviors of ECB
---------------------------------------------

ECB now offers to specify the behavior of commands like 'other-window'
or 'scroll-other-window' within the ECB-frame.  This can be done with
the option 'ecb-other-window-behavior'.  This option offers several
builtin behaviors:

   * All windows of the ECB-frame are considered

     ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll
     simply the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the
     original 'other-window' rsp.  the original
     'other-window-for-scrolling'.

   * Only the windows of the edit-area are considered

     ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only scroll
     another edit-window.  If the selected window is not an edit-window
     then all windows are taken into account.

   * The edit-windos and the compile-window are considered

     Like above but the compile-window will be added to the subset of
     the edit-windows.

   * Behave as smart and intuitive as possible

     This is the default behavior of ECB. ECB tries to choose the
     'other-window'-destination or the "other window" to scroll in a
     smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of the edit-windows and
     if the edit-area is splitted then always the "next" edit-window is
     choosen (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is
     the first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
     compile-window is used if there is one.  In the context of an
     'other-window'-call the ARG of 'other-window' will be taken into
     account.

     If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the
     "next" ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the
     last ecb-window is the first ecb-window).  In the context of an
     'other-window'-call the ARG of 'other-window' will be taken into
     account.

     If the compile-window is selected then always the last edit-window
     which had the point will be used unless 'other-window' has been
     called with a prefix-argument unequal 1.

Regardless of the different behaviors above ECB handles the situation of
an active minibuffer during a call to 'other-window' or
'scroll-other-window' like follows:

If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the window
'minibuffer-scroll-window' points to (when this variable is set,
otherwise the compile-window or the last selected edit-window is
choosen) when the called command is called to choose the 1.  next window
(always true for scrolling another window or true when 'other-window'
called without prefix-arg or with prefix-arg equal 1).  Otherwise the
window ARG steps away is choosen (in case of 'other-window').

If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not
selected then 'other-window' and 'scroll-other-window' behave like the
original version.

4.5.3 User-defined "other window" behavior
------------------------------------------

In addition to the builtin "other window" behaviors ECB offers a user to
completely define for himself how ECB should choose another window for
scrolling it or selecting it.  This can be done with the option
'ecb-other-window-behavior' too because this option can also have a
function-symbol as value:

Such a function gets seven arguments:
  1. A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the
     'ecb-frame'
  2. A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
  3. A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
  4. The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.
  5. The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active
     minibuffer.
  6. The result of the function 'ecb-where-is-point' - see the
     documentation of this function for details.
  7. An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current
     selected window the "other-window" is.  Is nil when this function
     is called in another context than for 'other-window'.

The function has to return a window-object which is then used as "other
window" for the command 'other-window' or for scrolling another window
(e.g.  with 'scroll-other-window').  Such a function has to handle
properly all situation for itself.

Here is an example for such a function:

     (defun ecb-get-other-window-smart (win-list
                                        edit-win-list
                                        ecb-win-list
                                        comp-win
                                        minibuf-win
                                        point-loc
                                        nth-window)
       "Implements the smart-setting of `ecb-other-window-behavior'."
       (if minibuf-win
           ;; if we have an active mini-buffer we delegate this to
           ;; `ecb-get-other-window-minibuf-active'
           (ecb-get-other-window-minibuf-active win-list
                                                edit-win-list
                                                ecb-win-list
                                                comp-win
                                                minibuf-win
                                                point-loc
                                                nth-window)
         ;; here we have no active minibuffer!
         (let ((nth-win (or nth-window 1)))
           (cond ((equal point-loc 'ecb)
                  (ecb-next-listelem ecb-win-list (selected-window) nth-win))
                 ((equal point-loc 'compile)
                  (if (= nth-win 1)
                      (or (and ecb-last-edit-window-with-point
                               (window-live-p ecb-last-edit-window-with-point)
                               ecb-last-edit-window-with-point)
                          (car edit-win-list))
                    (ecb-next-listelem (append edit-win-list
                                               (list (selected-window)))
                                       (selected-window)
                                       nth-win)))
                 (t ;; must be an edit-window
                  (ecb-next-listelem (append edit-win-list
                                             (if (and comp-win
                                                      (= (length edit-win-list)
                                                         1))
                                                 (list comp-win)))
                                     (selected-window)
                                     nth-win))))))

This example implements the builtin smart behavior described above.

4.6 Using and customizing the ECB-Methods buffer
================================================

ECB is mostly designed to display parsing information for files
supported by semantic.  But beginning with version 1.94 it also supports
other parsing engines like imenu and etags, so also files not supported
by semantic but by imenu/etags can be displayed in the Method-buffer of
ECB. Therefore we have to introduce some terminology:

   - "semantic-sources": These are file-types for which a semantic
     grammar is available, so the files are parse-able by semantic.
     These sources are supported best by ECB and most of the following
     options and descriptions are related to these file-types.  Examples
     are programming-sources like C++, C, Java, Emacs-Lisp and
     Texinfo-file and some more.

   - "non-semantic-sources": For these files there is no
     semantic-grammar available so they can not be parsed by semantic.
     Examples are Perl-, LaTeX- and TeX-files.  But for many of these
     files imenu and/or etags parsers exist.  ECB supports now parsing
     and displaying these file-types too and it uses for this some
     speedbar-logic.

This chapter describes how to use and customize the Methods-buffer of
ECB.

File: ecb.info,  Node: Visiting tags,  Next: Expanding,  Prev: The Methods buffer,  Up: The Methods buffer

4.6.1 Possible actions after visiting a tag
-------------------------------------------

You visit a tag by clicking with either the primary oder secondary
mouse-button (or by hitting 'RET' or 'C-RET' if using the keyboard) onto
a node in the Methods-tree-buffer of ECB. This simply selects the
"right" edit-window (depends if clicked with the primary or secondary
button, in how many windows the edit-area is splitted and the value of
'ecb-mouse-click-destination') and puts the point onto the first line of
the clicked tag.

But you can define if after this "basic" tag-visit-action more
additional actions should be performed by ECB. You can either use some
of the predefined actions (e.g.  highlighting the header-line of the
tag) or define own actions.  You can set different actions for different
major-modes.  All this is done via the option
'ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'.

The following actions are currently predefined:
   - 'ecb-tag-visit-highlight-tag-header'
   - 'ecb-tag-visit-smart-tag-start'
   - 'ecb-tag-visit-recenter'
   - 'ecb-tag-visit-recenter-top'
   - 'ecb-tag-visit-goto-doc-start'
   - 'ecb-tag-visit-narrow-tag'

See the documentation of these function for details what they do.

Per default ECB performs the actions 'ecb-tag-visit-smart-tag-start' and
'ecb-tag-visit-highlight-tag-header' for all major-modes.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Expanding,  Next: Customizing the display,  Prev: Visiting tags,  Up: The Methods buffer

4.6.2 Explicit and automatic expanding of the ECB-methods-buffer
----------------------------------------------------------------

4.6.2.1 Explicit expanding to a certain expanding level
.......................................................

With the command 'ecb-expand-methods-nodes' (bound to 'C-c . x') you can
get a fast overlook of the contents of the source-buffer, because this
command allows precisely expanding tags with a certain
indentation-level.  So you can either expand no tags (or with other
words collapse all tags) or expand all tags so see the contents of a
buffer at one glance.  Or you can expand exactly that tags of a certain
indentation level.

Which node-types are expanded (rsp.  collapsed) by this command depends
for semantic-sources on the options 'ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec' and
'ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec'!  For non-semantic-sources always all
node-types are expanded/collapsed, i.e.  the two options above takes no
effect for these files.

4.6.2.2 Automatic expansion ot tags after buffer-parsing
........................................................

With the option 'ecb-show-tags' you tell ECB how to display tags of a
certain tag-class (*note Customizing the display::).  Among other things
you can tell ECB that a certain tag-class should be combined under an
expanded or collapsed bucket-node.  But such a setting defines the
expansion-state of such a bucket-node only direct afterwards the buffer
has been (re)parsed, which can occur after opening a file, after autom.
reparsing the buffer via semantic or after manually rebuilding the
methods-buffer of ECB.

The tag-class 'type' (classes, interfaces, enumerations etc.)  is
divided into several subtypes by semantic.  The subtypes are stings
which names exactly if the tag with tag-class 'type' is a class, an
interface, an enumeration, a typedef etc.  With the option
'ecb-type-tag-expansion' you can tell ECB if these type-tags should be
autom.  expanded after (reparsing) a buffer (see above) or if they
should be displayed collapsed - so all its members (methods, variables
etc.)  are hidden.

4.6.2.3 Automatic expanding the ECB-methods-buffer for current tag
..................................................................

If the option 'ecb-highlight-tag-with-point' is switched on, then always
that node in the method-buffer is highlighted which belongs to the
current semantic-tag under point in the current active edit-window.  But
if this node is invisible (probably because its parent node is
collapsed) then no node is highlighted if the auto.  expanding feature
is switched off.

You can either switch on this feature with the option
'ecb-auto-expand-tag-tree' or even easier with the command
'ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree'.

There is another option 'ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand'
which makes both explicit and auto.  expanding best working together.
See the documentation of this option to get the details.

The autom.  expanding feature is only available for semantic-sources!

Previous versions of ECB have always fully expanded the whole tree in
the Methods-buffer if the current tag in the source-buffer was not
visible in the current tree - e.g.  because the variables-bucket was
collapsed or the containing type of a tag (e.g.  the class of a method)
was collapsed.  So in most cases much more was expanded as needed to
make the current tag visible.

The mechanism of ECB 2.22 and higher only expands the needed parts of
the tree-buffer to make the related node visible: First we try to
highlight the current tag with current expansion-state of the
Methods-buffer.  If the node is not visible so the tag can not be
highlighted then we go upstairs the ladder of type-tags the current tag
belongs to (e.g.  we expand successive the nodes of the whole
class-hierachy of the current method-tag until the related node becomes
visible).  If there is no containing type for the current tag then the
node of the tag is probably contained in a toplevel-bucket which is
currently collapsed; in this case we expand only this bucket-node and
try highlighting again.  Only if this has still no success then we
expand the full tree-buffer and try to highlight the current tag.

There is another option 'ecb-auto-expand-tag-tree-collapse-other': If
this option is set then auto.  expanding the tag-tree collapses all not
related nodes.  This means that all nodes which have no relevance for
the currently highlighted node will be collapsed, because they are not
necessary to make the highlighted node visible.  This feature is
switched off by default because if always collapses the complete
Methods-tree before the following highlighting of the node for the
current tag expands the needed parts of the tree-buffer.

4.6.3 Customizing the display of the Methods-buffer
---------------------------------------------------

The ECB-Methods buffer is probably the most important browsing window
offered by ECB. It displays all parsing informations of the current
source-buffer (the buffer displayed in the current active edit-window).

Normally ECB gets all informations displayed in this Methods-buffer from
the semantic-library - at least for semantic-sources.  This library
parses auto.  the current source-buffer in the edit-window of ECB and
returns all information in form of "tags" to ECB which displays them in
a browse-able form in its Method-buffer.  See *note ECB Methods-buffer::
for information how to use the Methods-buffer.

There are several options to customize which tags ECB should display in
general, if the tags should be collapsed or expanded, how to fontify
them (i.e.  syntax-highlighting) and something more.

'ecb-show-tags'
     With the option 'ecb-show-tags' you specify how ECB should display
     the tags returned by the semantic parser.  Semantic divides its
     tags in several so called "tag classes".  A tag-class is always a
     symbol and can be for example 'type' (tags which represent a
     class(1), a interface, an enumeration etc.), 'function' (tags which
     represent function or methods), 'variable' (variables and
     attributes), 'include' (import-statements) etc.  There is no
     predefined superset of allowed tag-class-symbols because each
     language-parser can define its own tag-classes.  But to get an
     overview of the most common tag-classes see the default value of
     the option 'ecb-show-tags'.

     With the option 'ecb-show-tags' you can now specify how ECB should
     display tags of a certain tag-class in a certain major-mode.  You
     can tell ECB that all tags of a tag-class 'X' should be displayed
     in an expanded bucket and all tags of a tag-class 'Y' should be
     displayed in a collapsed bucket and all tags of a tag-class 'Z'
     should be displayed flattened (means not contained in a
     expandable/collapsable bucket-node).  These settings can be made
     separately for each major-mode but you can also define a
     default-display which takes effect when for a major-mode no special
     setting can be found in 'ecb-show-tags'.

     For every tag-class you can tell ECB how the tags should be sorted.

'ecb-font-lock-tags'
'ecb-type-tag-display'
     How to fontify the tags in the Method-buffer

'ecb-tag-display-function'
     ECB and semantic offer several predefined functions for displaying
     the tags.  Here you can customize, what informations tags should
     contain (only the method-name or the whole signature or something
     else) and what notation should be used, e.g.  UML or not.

These are the most important options for this topic but it is
recommended to have a look into the customize-group 'ecb-methods' (*note
ecb-methods::) and check all the options offered there!

All these options are only relevant for semantic-sources and take no
effect for non-semantic-sources!

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Do not confuse the term "class" in the context of a tag, which
means the class of the tag and which is a semantic-term and a "class" in
the context of an object oriented language like Java or C++!  Normally
the surrounding context sould be sufficient to understand which type of
"class" is meant whenever the term "class" is used in this manual.

4.6.4 Rebuilding the Methods-buffer
-----------------------------------

In almost all cases there is *NO* need to manually rebuild the
method-buffer, because it is always done automatically if necessary; the
mechanism depends on the sources:

   - semantic-sources: The command 'global-semantic-auto-parse-mode'
     switches on autom.  reparsing of semantic-sources.

   - non-semantic-sources (imenu supported): You can switch on autom.
     rescanning/reparsing with the option 'imenu-auto-rescan'.  But
     nevertheless you have to manually rebuild the Method-buffer (with
     the autom.  updated imenu-tags) via the command
     'ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer' (bound to 'C-c . r').

   - non-semantic-sources (etags supported): For these sources there is
     no built-in auto-rescan mechanism, because etags is an external
     tool it can only operate on the saved file-contents.  So rescanning
     the buffer contents would need to save the buffer before.
     Therefore there is no built-in auto-rescan mechanism because this
     would always result in saving the buffer and running an external
     tool.  But of course you can program such a an etags-auto-rescan
     mechanism for yourself!

Besides for etags-supported non-semantic-sources there exist a few rare
scenarios also for the other sources where a complete manual rebuild can
be necessary.  Here is one example:

Depending on the semantic-version: If an Elisp-file is parsed which
contains a defun X in the middle where the closing ) is missing, then
semantic parses only until this defun X is reached and you will get an
incomplete ECB-method buffer.  In such a case you must complete the
defun X and then completely reparse the Elisp-file and rebuild the ECB
method buffer!

A complete manually rebuild is done by 'ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer'.
For etags-parsed non-semantic-sources this causes an automatic saving of
the source-buffer because otherwise etags would not operate with the
latest contents!

4.7 Applying filters to the special ECB-tree-buffers
====================================================

To get a fast and good overlook of the contents of a tree-buffer ECB
offers a filter-mechanism for the Sources-, the History- and the
Methods-buffer whereas the former one are quite identical.

File: ecb.info,  Node: Filtering Sources,  Next: Filtering Methods,  Prev: Filtering the tree-buffers,  Up: Filtering the tree-buffers

4.7.1 Applying filters to the Sources- and History-buffer
---------------------------------------------------------

The commands 'ecb-sources-filter' and 'ecb-history-filter' allow to
filter these tree-buffer either by a regular expression or by an
extension (e.g.  java, cc, el for java-, c++- rsp elisp-sources).  This
functionality is also available via the popup-menu of the particular
tree-buffer.

The currently applied filter is indicated in the modeline of the related
tree-buffer.  Applying a new filter replaces an eventually already
applied filter.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Filtering Methods,  Prev: Filtering Sources,  Up: Filtering the tree-buffers

4.7.2 Applying filters to the Methods-buffer
--------------------------------------------

The commands 'ecb-methods-filter', 'ecb-methods-filter-regexp',
'ecb-methods-filter-protection', 'ecb-methods-filter-tagclass',
'ecb-methods-filter-function', 'ecb-methods-filter-delete-last',
'ecb-methods-filter-nofilter' allows to filter the tags/nodes of the
Methods-buffer by several criterias.  As for the Sources- and the
History-buffer the same functionality is also available via the
popup-menu of the Methods-buffer.

4.7.2.1 Possible filter-criterias
.................................

   * Filter by protection: Just insert the protection you want the
     Methods-buffer being filtered: private, protected or public!  For
     sources not supported by semantic the protection filter will not be
     offered because these informations are not available for such
     sources.

   * Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

   * Filter by tag-class: You can filter by tag-classes.  The popup-menu
     contains mode-dependend tag-filter entries and the command
     'ecb-methods-filter' offers only the tag-classes of the current
     mode.  This means for sources not supported by semantic the
     tag-class filter will not be offered.  And for semantic-supported
     sources exactly these tag-classes are offered the semantic-parser
     for the current major-mode offers.  For example texi-sources can
     only be filtered by the tag-classes "Definitions" and "Sections"
     and java-sources can be filtered by "Methods", "Variables",
     "Classes" etc.  In general the semantic-variable
     'semantic-symbol->name-assoc-list' is used to get the right
     tag-classes.

   * Filter by a filter-function: Such a function gets two arguments: a
     tag and the source-buffer of this tag.  If the tag should be
     displayed (i.e.  not being filtered out) then the function has to
     return not nil otherwise nil.

   * No special filter: This means to display all tags specified with
     the option 'ecb-show-tokens'.  If currently some of the above
     filters are applied they will be all removed.

   * Delete the last added: This removes only the topmost filter-layer,
     means that filter added last.

Be aware that the tag-list specified by the option 'ecb-show-tags' is
the basis of all filters, i.e.  tags which are excluded by that option
will never be shown regardless of the filter type here!

All tags which match the applied filter(s) will be displayed in the
Methods-buffer.  Such a filter is only applied to the current
source-buffer, i.e.  each source-buffer can have its own tag-filters.

These tag-filters can also applied to sources which are not supported by
the semantic-parser but "only" by imenu or etags.  But because for these
sources not all information are avaiable the protection- and tag-class
filter are not offered with such "non-semantic"-sources.  See *note
Non-semantic sources:: for further details about working with
source-files not supported by the semantic-parser.

4.7.2.2 Inverse Filters
.......................

But if 'ecb-methods-filter' is called with a prefix-argument then an
inverse filter is applied to the Methods-buffer, i.e.  all tags which do
*NOT* match the choosen filter will be displayed in the Methods-buffer!

4.7.2.3 Layered filters
.......................

Per default the choosen filter will be applied on top of already
existing filters.  This means that filters applied before are combined
with the new filter.  This behavior can changed via the option
'ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing'.

4.7.2.4 Display of currently applied filters
............................................

The current active filter will be displayed in the modeline of the
Methods-buffer [regexp, prot (= protection), tag-class, function (=
filter-function)].  If an inverse filter has been applied then this is
signalized by a preceding caret ^.  If currently more than 1 filter is
applied then always the top-most filter is displayed in the modeline but
the fact of more than 1 filter is visualized by the number of the
filters - included in parens.  You can see all currently applied filters
by moving the mouse over the filter-string in modeline of the
Methods-buffer: They will displayed as help-echo.

4.7.2.5 Default filters for certain files.
..........................................

The new option 'ecb-default-tag-filter' allow to define default
tag-filters for certain files which are applied automatically after
loading such a file into a buffer.  The possible filters are the same as
offered by the command 'ecb-methods-filter' and they are applied in the
same manner - the only difference is they are applied automatically.
The files can be specified on a combined major-mode- and
filename-regexp-basis.

Usage-example: This can be used to display in outline-mode files (e.g.
'NEWS') only the level-1-headings by defining a filter regexp "^\* .*".

4.8.1 Changing and customizing the ECB-layout
---------------------------------------------

ECB offers several predefined layouts with different sets and also
different locations of ECB-windows.  See below the "ascii-screenshot" of
all currently built-in layouts(1).

In addition to these predefined layouts you can either interactively
create new layouts "by example" (*note Creating a new ECB-layout::) or
program new layouts with the macro 'ecb-layout-define' (*note The
layout-engine::).  The former method is the recommended one!

There are two ways to interactively change the layout:
   * Changing permanently: Customize the option 'ecb-layout-name' and
     store it for future Emacs sessions.

   * Switching between several layouts at runtime: If you want to switch
     fast between a certain sequence of layouts see the option
     'ecb-toggle-layout-sequence' and the command 'ecb-toggle-layout'
     (*note Simulating speedbar::).  For just selecting another layout
     during current Emacs-session use the command 'ecb-change-layout'.

With the option 'ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' you can define
if sources are displayed in the directory-window of a layout (*note ECB
Directories-buffer::).

In addition to the general layout you can specify if the layout should
contain a durable compilation-window at the bottom of the frame, see
'ecb-compile-window-height' (*note Temp- and compile-buffers::).

Maybe you want also change the look&feel of the tree-buffers.  Then you
can change the general style of the tree-buffers with the option
'ecb-tree-buffer-style' and the location of the collapse- and
expand-symbols and the indentation of sub-nodes in a tree.  See
'ecb-tree-indent' and 'ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'.  More details
about the different tree-buffer-styles are described in *note
Tree-buffer styles::.

Here are all currently available layouts (for creating own new layouts
see *note Creating a new ECB-layout::); just customize the option
'ecb-layout-name' to the related name:

4.8.2 Redrawing the ECB-layout
------------------------------

If you have unintentionally destroyed the ECB-layout, you can always
restore the layout with calling 'ecb-redraw-layout'.  This is even true,
if you get messages like "wrong-type-argument window-live-p #<window
222>".

If the variable 'ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the redraw
is done by the 'ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
'ecb-redraw-layout-full'.  But it's strongly recommended to use the
quick redraw only if you have really slow machines where a full redraw
takes several seconds because the quick redraw is not really safe and
may have some drawbacks!  On normal machines the full redraw should be
done in << 1s!

Please read the documentation of the command 'ecb-redraw-layout'!

See also the hooks 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook' and
'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'!

4.8.3 Changing the sizes of the special ECB-windows
---------------------------------------------------

The standard width and height of the special ECB-windows is defined with
the options 'ecb-windows-width' and 'ecb-windows-height'.  But changing
these options always influences all layouts which is not always desired.

ECB offers to re-adjust the width and height of the ECB-windows (e.g.
by dragging the windows-borders via the mouse) and then saving exactly
these current window-sizes for the current layout so after activating
this layout all windows have autom.  the stored sizes.

This is done via the option 'ecb-layout-window-sizes' and the commands
'ecb-store-window-sizes', 'ecb-restore-window-sizes' and
'ecb-restore-default-window-sizes'.

Here is an example how to resize and store the sizes of the ECB-windows
of layout "left1":

  1. Switch to layout "left1" via 'ecb-change-layout' ('C-c . lc')
  2. Resize the ECB-windows by dragging the window-borders with the
     mouse
  3. Call 'ecb-store-window-sizes'

After this layout "left1" will be always drawn with the new sizes until
you call 'ecb-restore-default-window-sizes' during layout "left1" is
active.

*Please note*: 'ecb-store-window-sizes' stores the width and height of
the windows per default as fractions of the width (rsp.  height) of the
ECB-frame, so the stored sizes are always correct regardless of the
current frame-size!  But if called with a prefix argument then fixed
sizes are stored.

4.8.4 Fixing the sizes of the special ECB-windows
-------------------------------------------------

GNU Emacs 21 introduced a new feature which can fix the sizes of a
window displaying a certain buffer even after resizing the frame.  This
new feature is driven by the new buffer-local variable
'window-size-fixed'.

ECB offers an option 'ecb-fix-window-size' for fixing the sizes of the
special ECB-windows/buffers even after frame-resizing.  The fix type
(valid values are 'nil', 't', 'width' and 'height') can either be set on
a layout-basis (means a different value for each layout) or one value
can be set for all layouts.  In the latter case there is an additional
value 'auto' which choose autom.  the senseful fix-type depending on the
current layout-type: For top-layouts the fix-type 'height' and for all
other layout-types the fix-type 'width'.

Probably the most senseful value is 'auto' for all layouts because it
makes less sense to fix the height of the ecb-windows in a left-, right-
or leftright-layout.  Same for fixing the width in a top-layout.

Note: With current Emacs 21.2.X there seems to be no distinction between
'width', 'height' and 't'.  Therefore this option takes no effect (means
all ecb-windows have always unfixed sizes) if
'ecb-compile-window-height' is not 'nil'.

4.8.5 Interactively creating new layouts
----------------------------------------

If you want to create your own ECB-layout then you can do this very easy
"by example" with the command 'ecb-create-new-layout'.  This command
creates a new empty frame and offers a small set of keys to create the
new layout by splitting windows.  'ecb-create-new-layout' and this
couple of keys are your guide during the layout-creation-process(1).

After calling 'ecb-create-new-layout' you will be asked which type of
layout you want to create: "left", "right", "top" or "left-right".  Here
you specify where the ECB-tree-windows/buffers should be located in the
ECB-frame:

   - left: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the left side
   - right: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the right side
   - top: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the top side
   - left-right: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the left and right
     side

Depending on the type you choose the window is splitted by the values of
the options 'ecb-windows-width' (types "left", "right" and "left-right")
or 'ecb-windows-height' (type "top").

Afterwards you will see a frame like follows (here the layout-type is
"left-right"):

The big window (here the middle window) will be the edit-area of the new
layout and can not be selected, deleted or splitted during the creation
process.  It displays the help-screen for the layout-creation mode.
Here all the available commands are displayed.

The small window(s) (here the left and right windows) can be splitted by
you wherever you want ('C-s').  The left one contains the point.  You
must give every ECB-tree-window you create a type ('C-t') which can be
either

   * One of the built-in types

     This can be either "directories", "sources", "methods", "history"
     or "speedbar".

   * Any user-defined type:

     In this case you insert "other" after hitting 'C-t' and you will
     then be asked for the name of the user-defined type.  You can
     insert any arbitrary type name X. But to get this layout working
     you have to define a function with name 'ecb-set-X-buffer' whereas
     X is the name of the user-defined type you have specified during
     layout-creation.

     This function 'ecb-set-X-buffer' has first to switch to the buffer
     you want to display in this window and then making this window
     dedicated.  You have to use the macro 'ecb-with-dedicated-window'
     in such a function!

     Here is an example: Suppose you have inserted as type name
     "example" then you have to define and load a function
     'ecb-set-example-buffer' which could be defined like follows:

          (defun ecb-set-example-buffer ()
            (ecb-with-dedicated-window
              " *ECB example-buffer*"
              'ecb-set-example-buffer
                (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create " *ECB example-buffer*"))))

     If you forget to define such a function for the user-defined type
     then nevertheless ECB will draw this layout but it will use the
     default-function 'ecb-set-default-ecb-buffer' instead.

If you are satisfied with your new layout just hit 'C-q'.  You will be
asked for a new layout-name (TAB-completion is offered to get a list of
all names already in use) and after inserting a new(!)  name the new
layout is saved in the file defined by the option
'ecb-create-layout-file'.  The new layout is now available via the
option 'ecb-layout-name'.

There is no need for you to load the file 'ecb-create-layout-file'
manually into your Emacs because it's automatically loaded by ECB!

*Please note*: During the layout-creation process only the commands
displayed in the help-screen are available.  ALL other commands are
temporally disabled (even the mouse-commands).

For programming new layouts with emacs-lisp see *note The
layout-engine::.

With the command 'ecb-delete-new-layout' you can delete previously
created layouts (TAB-completion is offered for all names of user created
layouts).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) During the creation process you will be asked in the minibuffer
for several options; here you can use TAB-completion and an "empty" RET
chooses always the first option!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Hiding the ECB windows,  Next: Maximizing the ECB windows,  Prev: The ECB-layout,  Up: Usage of ECB

4.9 Hiding/Showing the ECB windows
==================================

With 'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows', 'ecb-hide-ecb-windows' and
'ecb-show-ecb-windows' you can hide/show all the ECB windows without
changing the activation state of ECB and also without deactivating the
advices for 'delete-other-windows' and/or 'delete-window'.  This is most
useful if you use a layout like "top2" (*note Tips and tricks::) or if
you want to have maximum space for editing and you don't need the
browsing windows all the time.

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during showing again the
hidden ECB-windows:
  1. 'ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook'
  2. 'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'
  3. <Redrawing the layout to show the hidden ECB-windows>
  4. 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
  5. 'ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook'

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during hiding the
ECB-windows:
  1. 'ecb-hide-ecb-windows-before-hook'
  2. 'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'
  3. <Hiding the ECB-windows>
  4. 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
  5. 'ecb-hide-ecb-windows-after-hook'

If the special ECB-windows are hidden (e.g.  by
'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows') all adviced functions behave as their
originals.  So the frame can be used as if ECB would not be active but
ECB IS still active in the "background" and all ECB-commands and all
ECB-keybindings can be used.  Of course some of them doesn't make much
sense but nevertheless they can be called.  Toggling the visibility of
the ECB-windows preserves the splitting-state of the edit-area: If you
hide the ECB-windows then the frame will be divided in the same
window-layout the edit-area had before the hiding and if you show the
ECB-windows again the edit-area will be divided into all the
edit-windows the ECB-frame had before the showing.

Therefore it should be enough to hide the ECB-windows to run other
Emacs-applications which have their own window-layout-managing.  There
should be no conflicts.  But nevertheless the most recommended method
for running ECB and other applications (e.g.  xrefactory, Gnus etc.)  in
the same frame is to use a window-manager like winring.el or escreen.el
(*note Window-managers and ECB::).

4.10 Maximizing the ECB windows
===============================

To get a better overlook about the contents of a certain ECB-window
every ECB-window can be "maximized", means all other ECB-windows are
deleted so only the edit-window(s) and this maximized ECB-window are
visible (and maybe a compile-window if active).  There are several ways
to do this:

   * Via the popup-menus of the ECB-windows

   * Via the main "ECB"-menu and here "Display window maximized"

   * Via calling the adviced version of 'delete-other-windows'(1) (bound
     to 'C-x 1') in one of the ECB windows.

   * Via one of the commands 'ecb-maximize-window-directories',
     'ecb-maximize-window-sources', 'ecb-maximize-window-methods',
     'ecb-maximize-window-history' or 'ecb-maximize-window-speedbar' or
     the bound short-cuts for those commands.

   * Via the new command 'ecb-cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers' which cycles
     through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing exactly one
     of the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.

   * Via the option 'ecb-maximize-ecb-window-after-selection' and then
     just by selecting an ECB-window.  "Deselecting" an ECB-window
     brings back all ECB-windows of current layout.

   * Via the default modeline-mechanisms for deleting other windows.
     GNU Emacs binds 'mouse-2' in its modeline to 'delete-other-window'.
     ECB now supports this mechanism by binding a toggle-command to
     'mouse-2' in the modeline of each tree-buffer: If all ECB-windows
     are visible then this command maximizes the current tree-window and
     if current tree-window is maximized all ECB-windows are displayed
     again.  XEmacs binds a popup-menu with some window commands to
     'button-3' in its modeline.  ECB supports this mechanism by
     replacing this menu by a menu which offers exactly 2 commands:
     Maximizing current tree-window and displaying all ECB-windows.

Minimizing such a maximized ECB-window, i.e.  bringing back to its
original size, can simply be done by redrawing the layout via the
command 'ecb-redraw-layout' (bound to 'C-c . lr').

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This command is adviced per default, see *note The edit-area::.

4.11 Back- and forward navigation like a browser
================================================

With ECB you can "browse" in your source-files like with a web-browser.
This means ECB stores the current buffer- and window-position relative
to the current tag(1) in the edit-window after

   - selecting a tag in the ECB-methods buffer or
   - selecting a source-file in the ECB-sources/history-buffer.

ECB offers two commands 'ecb-nav-goto-next' ('C-c . n') and
'ecb-nav-goto-previous' ('C-c . p') to go forward and backward within
this navigation history-list.  These commands are also available via the
menu "ECB -> Navigate".

Aside normal "location-browsing" this is useful for example in a
scenario where the buffer is narrowed to a tag (see
'ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'):

  1. You edit a function
  2. Goto another function above the current in the same file
  3. Add a few lines
  4. Call ecb-nav-goto-previous

     Now you will edit at the same place in the function.

4.12 Synchronization of the ECB-windows
=======================================

Per default ECB synchronizes automatically the contents of the
ECB-windows/tree-buffers with the current active edit-window (rsp.  the
current buffer of the edit window):

   * ECB-directories:

     This windows is synchronized to display the directory where the
     source-file which is displayed in the current active edit-window is
     located.  If the source-path (i.e.  an element of the option
     'ecb-source-path') containing this directory is not expanded it
     will be auto.  expanded according to the value of the option
     'ecb-auto-expand-directory-tree' (*note ecb-directories::).

   * ECB-sources:

     The ECB-sources-buffer contains after synchronizing all the sources
     of the directory of the "current" source-file displayed in the
     edit-window.  The entry of the "current" source-file is
     highlighted.

   * ECB-methods:

     Contains after synchronizing all the tags of the buffer in the
     current selected edit-window, i.e.  all methods, variables etc...
     depending of the major-mode.

   * ECB-history:

     Highlights the entry of the buffer displayed in the current active
     edit-window if this buffer is a source-file.

This feature can be customized with the option 'ecb-window-sync':

If active then the synchronization takes place always a buffer changes
in an edit window or if another edit-window with another buffer will be
selected, if deactivated then never.  But you can also set this option
to a list of major-modes and then the sync.  will only be done if the
major-mode of the current buffer belongs NOT to this list.

But in every case the synchronization takes only place if the major-mode
of the current-buffer in the current selected edit-window has a relation
to files or directories.  Examples for the former one are all
programming-language-modes like 'c++-mode' or 'java-mode', 'Info-mode'
too, an example for the latter one is 'dired-mode'.  For all major-modes
related to non-file/directory-buffers like 'help-mode', 'customize-mode'
and others never a synchronization will be done!

It's recommended to exclude at least 'Info-mode' because it makes no
sense to synchronize the ECB-windows after calling the Info help.  Per
default also 'dired-mode' is excluded but it can also making sense to
synchronize the ECB-directories/sources windows with the current
directory of the dired-buffer in the edit-window.

If you often need to toggle between autom.  synchronization on and off
then customizing the option 'ecb-window-sync' is inefficient and
therefore ECB offers the command 'ecb-toggle-window-sync'.

*Please note*: With the command 'ecb-window-sync' you can do a manually
synchronization if the automatic one is switched off or if you just want
to do this!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Interactive ECB commands,  Prev: ECB-window synchronizing,  Up: Usage of ECB

4.13 Interactive ECB commands
=============================

ECB offers a lot of interactive commands.  Some of these commands prompt
the user in the minibuffer if called with a prefix argument.

Example: If 'ecb-clear-history' is called with a prefix argument then
you will be prompted in the minibuffer with:

     Clear from history: [all, not-existing-buffers, existing-buffers]

You can choose one of the options enclosed in brackets with
TAB-completion; hitting RET direct after the prompt chooses auto.  the
first offered option (in the example above "all").

*Please note*: The following interactive commands of ECB are listed
without the prefix "ecb-" (e.g.  the command 'ecb-activate' is listed
with name "activate").  This has been done for a better readable command
index.  *Note Command Index::.

 -- Command: activate
     Activates ECB and creates the special buffers for the choosen
     layout.  For the layout see 'ecb-layout-name'.  This function
     raises always the ECB-frame if called from another frame.  This is
     the same as calling 'ecb-minor-mode' with a positive argument.

 -- Command: add-all-buffers-to-history
     Add all current file-buffers to the history-buffer of ECB. If
     'ecb-sort-history-items' is not nil then afterwards the history is
     sorted alphabetically.  Otherwise the most recently used buffers
     are on the top of the history and the seldom used buffers at the
     bottom.

 -- Command: change-layout &optional preselect-type
     Select a layout-name from all current available layouts
     (TAB-completion is offered) and change the layout to the selected
     layout-name.  If optional argument PRESELECT-TYPE is not nil then
     you can preselect a layout-type \(TAB-completion is offered too)
     and then you will be asked only for layouts of that preselected
     type.  Note: This function works by changing the option
     'ecb-layout-name' but only for current Emacs-session.

 -- Command: clear-history
     Clears the history-buffer.

 -- Command: customize
     Open a customize-buffer for all customize-groups of ECB.

 -- Command: customize-most-important
     Open a customize-buffer for the most important options of ECB.

 -- Command: create-new-layout
     Start process for interactively creating a new ECB-layout (*note
     Creating a new ECB-layout::).

 -- Command: cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers
     Cycles through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing
     exactly one of the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.

 -- Command: cycle-through-compilation-buffers &optional choose-buffer
     Cycle through all compilation buffers currently open and display
     them within the compilation window 'ecb-compile-window'.  If the
     currently opened buffer within the compilation window is not a
     compilation buffer, we jump to the first compilation buffer.  If
     not we try to loop through all compilation buffers.  If we hit the
     end we go back to the beginning.

     If CHOOSE-BUFFER is not 'nil' then the user will be prompted for
     the compilation-buffer to switch to.

 -- Command: deactivate
     Deactivates the ECB and kills all ECB buffers and windows.

 -- Command: delete-new-layout
     Select a layout-name for a layout created by
     'ecb-create-new-layout' and delete this layout.  This means the
     layout-definition is removed from the file 'ecb-create-layout-file'
     and the layout-function and associated aliases are unbound.

 -- Command: display-news-for-upgrade &optional FULL-NEWS
     Display the most important NEWS after an ECB-upgrade.  If you call
     this function but no ECB-upgrade has been performed before starting
     ECB then nothing is display unless FULL-NEWS is not nil.

     If FULL-NEWS is not nil then the NEWS-file is displayed in another
     window.

 -- Command: display-upgraded-options
     Display a message-buffer which options have been upgraded or reset.

 -- Command: download-ecb
     Download ECB from the ECB-website and install it.  For this the
     option 'ecb-download-url' must be set correct, whereas the default
     value of this option should always be correct.

     If 'ecb-download-package-version-type' is set to -1 (means asking
     for a version) then you will be ask in the minibuffer for the
     version to download.  Otherwise ECB downloads autom.  the latest
     version available for the type specified in
     'ecb-download-package-version-type'.  If no newer version than the
     current one is available no download will be done.

     For details about downloading and what requirements must be
     satisfied see function 'ecb-package-download' and option
     'ecb-download-package-version-type'!

     After successful downloading the new ECB will be installed in a
     subdirectory of 'ecb-download-install-parent-dir'.  After adding
     this subdirectory to 'load-path' and restarting Emacs the new ECB
     version can be activated by 'ecb-activate'.

     If current running ECB is installed as regular XEmacs-package and
     not with the archive available at the ECB website then this
     function asks for proceeding!

 -- Command: download-semantic
     Download semantic from the semantic-website and install it.  For
     this the variable 'ecb-cedet-url' must be set correct, whereas the
     default value of this variable should always be correct.

     If 'ecb-download-package-version-type' is set to -1 (means asking
     for a version) then you will be ask in the minibuffer for the
     version to download.  Otherwise ECB downloads autom.  the latest
     version available for the type specified in
     'ecb-download-package-version-type'.  If no newer version than the
     current one is available no download will be done.

     For details about downloading and what requirements must be
     satisfied see function 'ecb-package-download' and option
     'ecb-download-package-version-type'!

     After successful downloading the new semantic will be installed in
     a subdirectory of 'ecb-download-install-parent-dir'.  After adding
     this new subdirectory to 'load-path' and restarting Emacs the new
     semantic version is loaded and is used after next start of ECB.

     If current running semantic is installed as regular XEmacs-package
     and not with the archive available at the semantic website then
     this function asks for proceeding!

 -- Command: expand-methods-nodes &optional force-all
     Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-methods-buffer.

     This command asks in the minibuffer for an indentation level LEVEL.
     With this LEVEL you can precisely specify which level of nodes
     should be expanded.  LEVEL means the indentation-level of the
     nodes.

     A LEVEL value X means that all nodes with an indentation-level <= X
     are expanded and all other are collapsed.  A negative LEVEL value
     means all visible nodes are collapsed.

     Nodes which are not indented have indentation-level 0!

     Which node-types are expanded (rsp.  collapsed) by this command
     depends on the options 'ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec' and
     'ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec'!  With optional argument
     FORCE-ALL all tags will be expanded/collapsed regardless of the
     values of these options.

     Examples:
        - LEVEL = 0 expands only nodes which have no indentation itself.
        - LEVEL = 2 expands nodes which are either not indented or
          indented indented once or twice
        - LEVEL ~ 10 should normally expand all nodes expect there are
          nodes which are indented deeper than 10.

     Note 1: This command switches off auto.  expanding of the
     method-buffer if 'ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand' is not
     nil.  But it can be switched on again quickly with
     'ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree' or '[C-c . a]'.

     Note 2: All this is only valid for file-types parsed by semantic.
     For other file types which are parsed by imenu or etags (see
     'ecb-process-non-semantic-files') FORCE-ALL is always true!

 -- Command: dump-semantic-toplevel
     Dump the current semantic-tags in special buffer and display them.

 -- Command: eshell-current-buffer-sync
     Synchronize the eshell with the directory of current source-buffer.
     This is only done if the eshell is currently visible in the
     compile-window of ECB and if either this function is called
     interactively or 'ecb-eshell-synchronize' is not nil.

 -- Command: eshell-recenter
     Recenter the eshell window so that the prompt is at the buffer-end.

 -- Command: expand-directory-nodes
     Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-directories-buffer.
     For argument LEVEL see 'ecb-expand-methods-nodes'.

     Be aware that for deep structured paths and a lot of source-paths
     this command can last a long time - depending of machine- and
     disk-performance.

 -- Command: goto-window-compilation
     Goto the ecb compilation window 'ecb-compile-window'.

 -- Command: goto-window-directories
     Make the ECB-directories window the current window.  If
     'ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is 'dir' then goto to
     the speedbar-window.

 -- Command: goto-window-edit1
     Make the (first) edit-window window the current window.

 -- Command: goto-window-edit2
     Make the second edit-window (if available) window the current
     window.

 -- Command: goto-window-edit-last
     Make the last selected edit-window window the current window.  This
     is the same as if 'ecb-mouse-click-destination' is set to
     'last-point'.

 -- Command: goto-window-history
     Make the ECB-history window the current window.

 -- Command: goto-window-methods
     Make the ECB-methods window the current window.  If
     'ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is 'method' then goto
     to the speedbar-window.

 -- Command: goto-window-sources
     Make the ECB-sources window the current window.  If
     'ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is 'source' then goto
     to the speedbar-window.

 -- Command: history-filter
     Apply a filter to the history-buffer to reduce the number of
     entries.  So you get a better overlooking.  There are three
     choices:

        - Filter by extension: Just insert the extension you want the
          History-buffer being filtered.  Insert the extension without
          leading dot!

        - Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

        - No filter: This means to display an entry for all currently
          living file-buffers.

 -- Command: jde-display-class-at-point
     Display in the ECB-methods-buffer the contents (methods, attributes
     etc...)  of the class which contains the definition of the "thing"
     under point (this can be a variable-name, class-name, method-name,
     attribute-name).  This function needs the same requirements to work
     as the method-completion feature of JDEE (see 'jde-complete')!.
     The source-file is searched first in 'jde-sourcepath', then in
     'jde-global-classpath', then in $CLASSPATH, then in
     current-directory.

     Works only for classes where the source-code (i.e.  the
     *.java-file) is available.

 -- Command: maximize-window-directories
     Maximize the ECB-directories-window, i.e.  delete all other
     ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are
     visible (and maybe a compile-window).  Works also if the
     ECB-directories-window is not visible in current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-sources
     Maximize the ECB-sources-window, i.e.  delete all other
     ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are
     visible (and maybe a compile-window).  Works also if the
     ECB-sources-window is not visible in current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-methods
     Maximize the ECB-methods-window, i.e.  delete all other
     ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are
     visible (and maybe a compile-window).  Works also if the
     ECB-methods-window is not visible in current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-history
     Maximize the ECB-history-window, i.e.  delete all other
     ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are
     visible (and maybe a compile-window).  Works also if the
     ECB-history-window is not visible in current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-speedbar
     Maximize the ECB-speedbar-window, i.e.  delete all other
     ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are
     visible (and maybe a compile-window).  Does nothing if the
     speedbar-window is not visible within the ECB-frame.

 -- Command: methods-filter
     Apply a filter to the Methods-buffer to reduce the number of
     entries.  So you get a better overlooking.  There are six choices:

        * Filter by protection: Just insert the protection you want the
          Methods-buffer being filtered: private, protected or public!

        * Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

        * Filter by tag-class: You can filter by the tag-classes of
          current major-mode.  The available tag-classes come from the
          variable 'semantic--symbol->name-assoc-list'.  The are
          normally methods, variables etc.

        * Filter by current type: In languages which have types like
          Java or C++ this filter displays only the current type and all
          its members (e.g.  attributes and methods).  If ECB can not
          identify the current type in the source-buffer or in the
          methods-window then nothing will be done.

        * Filter by a filter-function: Such a function gets two
          arguments: a tag and the source-buffer of this tag.  If the
          tag should be displayed (i.e.  not being filtered out) then
          the function has to return not nil otherwise nil.

        * No special filter: This means to display all tags specified
          with the option 'ecb-show-tokens'.  If currently some of the
          above filters are applied they will be all removed.

        * Delete the last added: This removes only the topmost
          filter-layer, means that filter added last.

     The protection-, current-type- and the tag-class-filter are only
     available for semantic-supported sources.

     Be aware that the tag-list specified by the option 'ecb-show-tags'
     is the basis of all filters, i.e.  tags which are excluded by that
     option will never be shown regardless of the filter type here!

     All tags which match the applied filter(s) will be displayed in the
     Methods-buffer.

     If called with a prefix-argument or when optional arg INVERSE is
     not nil then an inverse filter is applied to the Methods-buffer,
     i.e.  all tags which do NOT match the choosen filter will be
     displayed in the Methods-buffer!

     Per default the choosen filter will be applied on top of already
     existing filters.  This means that filters applied before are
     combined with the new filter.  This behavior can changed via the
     option 'ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing'.  But regardless of
     the setting in 'ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing' applying one
     of the not-inverse filters protection, tag-class or current-type
     always replaces exactly already existing filters of that type.  On
     the other hand applying more than one inverse tag-class- or
     protection-filter can make sense.

     Such a filter is only applied to the current source-buffer, i.e.
     each source-buffer can have its own tag-filters.

     The current active filter will be displayed in the modeline of the
     Methods-buffer [regexp, prot (= protection), tag-class, function (=
     filter-function)].  If an inverse filter has been applied then this
     is signalized by a preceding caret ^.  If currently more than 1
     filter is applied then always the top-most filter is displayed in
     the modeline but the fact of more than 1 filter is visualized by
     the number of the filters - included in parens.  You can see all
     currently applied filters by moving the mouse over the
     filter-string in modeline of the Methods-buffer: They will
     displayed as help-echo.

     See the option 'ecb-default-tag-filter' if you search for
     automatically applied default-tag-filters.

 -- Command: methods-filter-current-type
     Display in the Methods-buffer only the current type and its
     members.  For further details see 'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-delete-last
     Remove the most recent filter from the Methods-buffer.  For further
     details see 'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-function &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by a function.  If INVERSE is not nil
     (called with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied.  For
     further details see 'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-nofilter
     Remove any filter from the Methods-buffer.  For further details see
     'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-protection &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by protection.  If INVERSE is not nil
     (called with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied.  For
     further details see 'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-regexp &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by a regexp.  If INVERSE is not nil
     (called with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied.  For
     further details see 'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-tagclass &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by tag-class.  If INVERSE is not nil
     (called with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied.  For
     further details see 'ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: minor-mode &optional arg
     Toggle ECB minor mode.  With prefix argument ARG, turn on if
     positive, otherwise off.  Return non-'nil' if the minor mode is
     enabled.

 -- Command: nav-goto-previous
     Go backward in the navigation history-list, see *note Back/forward
     navigation::.

 -- Command: nav-goto-next
     Go forward in the navigation history-list, see *note Back/forward
     navigation::.

 -- Command: rebuild-methods-buffer
     Updates the methods buffer with the current buffer after deleting
     the complete previous parser-information, means no semantic-cache
     is used!  Point must stay in an edit-window otherwise nothing is
     done.  This method is merely needed for semantic parsed buffers if
     semantic parses not the whole buffer because it reaches a not
     parse-able code or for buffers not supported by semantic but by
     imenu or etags.

     Examples when a call to this function can be necessary:

        * If an Elisp-file is parsed which contains in the middle a
          defun X where the closing ) is missing then semantic parses
          only until this defun X is reached and you will get an
          incomplete ECB-method buffer.  In such a case you must
          complete the defun X and then call this function to completely
          reparse the Elisp-file and rebuild the ECB method buffer!

        * For not semantic supported buffers which can be parsed by
          imenu or etags (see 'ecb-process-non-semantic-files') because
          for these buffers there is no built-in auto-rebuild mechanism.
          For these buffers this command calls
          'ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer-for-non-semantic'.

     For non-semantic-sources supported by etags the option
     'ecb-auto-save-before-etags-methods-rebuild' is checked before
     rescanning the source-buffer and rebuilding the methods-buffer.

     If point is in one of the ecb-windows or in the compile-window then
     this command rebuids the methods-buffer with the contents of the
     source-buffer the last selected edit-window.

 -- Command: redraw-layout &optional ARG
     Redraw the ECB screen.

     Do not call this command from elisp-program but only interactively!

     Called without a prefix-argument the state of the ECB-frame-layout
     will preserved.  This means:

        - The state of compile-window (hidden or visible) will be
          preserved but if visible then the height will be as specified
          in 'ecb-compile-window-height'.

        - The state of the ECB-windows will be preserved (hidden or
          visible) but if visible then the sizes will be as specified in
          the layout (and with the options 'ecb-windows-width' and
          'ecb-windows-height') or as stored with
          'ecb-store-window-sizes'.

     If called with ONE prefix-argument ('[C-u]') then the layout will
     be drawn with all ECB-windows and also with a visible
     compile-window (when 'ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil).  The
     splitting-state of the edit-area will be preserved.

     If called with TWO prefix-arguments (i.e.  hitting '[C-u]' twice:
     ('[C-u]' '[C-u]') then an emergency-redraw will be performed.  This
     means the same as if called with one prefix-argument (s.a.)  but
     the splitting-state of the edit-area will NOT be preserved but all
     edit-windows besides the current one will be deleted.  Use this
     only if there are some anomalies after standard redraws!

     If the variable 'ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the
     redraw is done by the 'ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function,
     otherwise by 'ecb-redraw-layout-full'.

     Please not: It's strongly recommended to use the quick redraw only
     if you have really slow machines where a full redraw takes several
     seconds because the quick redraw is not really safe and has some
     annoying drawbacks!  On normal machines the full redraw should be
     done in << 1s so there should be no need for the quick version!

 -- Command: restore-default-window-sizes
     Resets the sizes of the ECB windows to their default values.

 -- Command: restore-window-sizes
     Sets the sizes of the ECB windows to their stored values.  See
     option 'ecb-layout-window-sizes' and command
     'ecb-store-window-sizes'.

 -- Command: select-ecb-frame
     Selects the 'ecb-frame' if ECB is activated - otherwise reports an
     error.

 -- Command: show-help &optional format
     Shows the online help of ECB either in Info or in HTML format
     depending of the value of 'ecb-show-help-format'.  If called with
     prefix argument, i.e.  if FORMAT is not nil then the user is
     prompted to choose the format of the help (Info or HTML). If an
     error about not finding the needed help-file occurs please take a
     look at the options 'ecb-help-info-start-file' and
     'ecb-help-html-start-file'!

     Note: If you got ECB as a standard XEmacs-package maybe the
     HTML-online-documentation is not included.

 -- Command: show-layout-help
     Select a name of a layout and shows the documentation of the
     associated layout-function.  At least for the built-in layouts the
     documentation contains a picture of the outline of the chosen
     layout.

 -- Command: show-tip-of-the-day
     Show tip of the day if 'ecb-tip-of-the-day' is not nil or if called
     interactively.

 -- Command: sources-filter
     Apply a filter to the sources-buffer to reduce the number of
     entries.  So you get a better overlooking.  There are three
     choices:

        - Filter by extension: Just insert the extension you want the
          Sources-buffer being filtered.  Insert the extension without
          leading dot!

        - Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

        - No filter: This means to display an entry for every file in
          the current selected directory (all except these filter
          already filtered out by 'ecb-source-file-regexps' and
          'ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore').

     Such a filter is only applied to the current selected directory,
     i.e.  each directory has its own filtered sources-buffer.

 -- Command: store-window-sizes &optional fix
     Stores the sizes of the ECB windows for the current layout.  The
     size of the ECB windows will be set to their stored values when
     'ecb-redraw-layout' or 'ecb-restore-window-sizes' is called.  To
     reset the window sizes to their default values call
     'ecb-restore-default-window-sizes'.  Please read also the
     documentation of 'ecb-layout-window-sizes'!

     The windows sizes are stored per default as fractions of current
     frame-width and -height of the ecb-frame, so the stored values will
     "work" for other frame sizes too.  But if FIX is not nil (means
     called with a prefix argument) then the fixed values of current
     width and height are stored!

 -- Command: submit-problem-report
     Submit a problem report for the ECB to the ECB mailing-list.  This
     command generates in the edit-window a problem-report which
     contains already the current values of all ECB options, the current
     backtrace-buffer if there is any and the current message-buffer.
     You will be asked for a problem-report subject and then you must
     insert a description of the problem.  Please describe the problem
     as detailed as possible!

 -- Command: toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree &optional arg
     Toggle auto expanding of the ECB-methods-buffer.  With prefix
     argument ARG, make switch on if positive, otherwise switch off.  If
     the effect is that auto-expanding is switched off then the current
     value of 'ecb-auto-expand-tag-tree' is saved so it can be used for
     the next switch on by this command.

 -- Command: toggle-compile-window &optional arg
     Toggle the visibility of the compile-window of ECB. With prefix
     argument ARG, make visible if positive, otherwise invisible.  The
     height of the compile-window is always the current value of
     'ecb-compile-window-height'!  If called and
     'ecb-compile-window-height' is nil then ECB asks for the height of
     the compile-window, sets this height as new value of
     'ecb-compile-window-height' and displays the compile-window (so if
     you have called this command by mistake and you do not want a
     compile-window you have to quit with <C-g>).

 -- Command: toggle-compile-window-height &optional arg
     Toggle whether the 'ecb-compile-window' is enlarged or not.  If ARG
     > 0 then shrink or enlarge the the compile-window according to the
     value of 'ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height'.  But never
     shrink below the value of 'ecb-compile-window-height'.  If ARG <= 0
     then shrink 'ecb-compile-window' to 'ecb-compile-window-height' and
     if ARG is nil then toggle the enlarge-state.

 -- Command: toggle-ecb-windows &optional arg
     Toggle visibility of the ECB-windows.  With prefix argument ARG,
     make visible if positive, otherwise invisible.  This has nothing to
     do with (de)activating ECB but only affects the visibility of the
     ECB windows.  ECB minor mode remains active!

 -- Command: toggle-layout &optional last-one
     Toggles between the layouts defined in 'ecb-toggle-layout-sequence'
     (See also option 'ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer').  Note:
     This function works by changing the options 'ecb-layout-name' but
     only for current Emacs-session.

     If optional argument LAST-ONE is not nil (e.g.  called with a
     prefix-arg) then always the last selected layout was choosen
     regardless of the setting in 'ecb-toggle-layout-sequence'.  The
     last selected layout is always that layout which was current direct
     before the most recent layout-switch.  So now a user can switch to
     another layout via 'ecb-change-layout' and always come back to his
     previous layout via '[C-u]' 'ecb-toggle-layout'.

 -- Command: toggle-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile &optional ARG
     Toggle the state of
     'ecb-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile-window'.  With prefix
     argument ARG, set it to 't', otherwise to 'nil'.  For all details
     about the scroll-behavior of 'scroll-other-window' see the advice
     documentation of 'other-window-for-scrolling'.

 -- Command: toggle-window-sync &optional arg
     Toggle auto synchronizing of the ECB-windows.  With prefix argument
     ARG, switch on if positive, otherwise switch off.  If the effect is
     that auto-synchronizing is switched off then the current value of
     the option 'ecb-window-sync' is saved so it can be used for the
     next switch on by this command.  See also the option
     'ecb-window-sync'.

 -- Command: update-directories-buffer
     Updates the ECB directories buffer.

 -- Command: upgrade-options
     Check for all ECB-options if their current value is compatible to
     the defined type.  If not upgrade it to the new type or reset it to
     the default-value of current ECB. Try also to upgrade renamed
     options.  Displays all upgraded or reset options with their old
     (before the upgrade/reset) and new values.

 -- Command: window-sync
     Synchronizes all special ECB-buffers with current buffer.

     Depending on the contents of current buffer this command performs
     different synchronizing tasks but only if ECB is active and point
     stays in an edit-window.

        * If current buffer is a file-buffer then all special
          ECB-tree-buffers are synchronized with current buffer.

        * If current buffer is a dired-buffer then the directory- and
          the sources-tree-buffer are synchronized if visible

     In addition to this the hooks in 'ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook'
     run.

Most of these functions are also available via the menu "ECB" and also
via the ECB key-map with prefix 'C-c .' (see 'ecb-minor-mode' for a
complete list of the keybindings).

5.1 General aspects for customizing ECB
=======================================

This chapter contains all important informations you should know about
customizing ECB. The first section gives an answer to the question
"'setq' or 'customize'" and the second section describes what to do when
you have to customize ECB for a lot of people.

* Menu:

* setq or customize::           Should i use setq or customize?
* Site-wide customizing::       Site-wide customizing of ECB


File: ecb.info,  Node: setq or customize,  Next: Site-wide customizing,  Prev: General aspects,  Up: General aspects

5.1.1 Setq or customize - what should i use?
--------------------------------------------

The best way to customize all the options of ECB is via the
customize-feature of (X)Emacs, i.e.  means calling the commands
'customize-option' or 'customize-group' etc.  This is also the strongly
recommended way!

But of course you can also use 'setq' or some Elisp-code to change the
values of many but not all of the options.  The values of the following
options *MUST NOT* be changed via 'setq' or Elisp-code but only with the
customize-feature!

   - 'ecb-advice-window-functions'
   - 'ecb-bucket-node-display'
   - 'ecb-compile-window-height'
   - 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge'
   - 'ecb-compile-window-width'
   - 'ecb-exclude-parents-regexp'
   - 'ecb-fix-window-size'
   - 'ecb-font-lock-tags'
   - 'ecb-highlight-tag-with-point-delay'
   - 'ecb-key-map'
   - 'ecb-layout-name'
   - 'ecb-layout-window-sizes'
   - 'ecb-mode-line-data'
   - 'ecb-mode-line-display-window-number'
   - 'ecb-mode-line-prefixes'
   - 'ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer'
   - 'ecb-show-tags'
   - 'ecb-source-path'
   - 'ecb-toggle-layout-sequence'
   - 'ecb-tag-display-function'
   - 'ecb-tree-RET-selects-edit-window'
   - 'ecb-type-tag-display'
   - 'ecb-type-tag-expansion'
   - 'ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer'

5.1.2 Site-wide customizing of ECB
----------------------------------

If you are the administrator for an Emacs-site, means you are
responsible for the basic customization of a lot of Emacs users, then
you maybe need a way to customize Emacs and ECB without changing
everyones '.emacs'-file and normally you will do this with the file
'site-start.el'.  You can customize all options of ECB in a central
'site-start.el' (even the options mentioned above!)  but you *MUST NOT*
do this via 'setq' but you have to use a mechanism like the
following(1)!

This section describes two methods how to pre-customize ECB site-wide.
The elisp-code contained in the following two subsections has to be
copied to the file 'site-start.el' before it can be used.

But ensure for both methods that you customize the options with the
correct lisp format.  Read carefully the docstrings of the options you
want to customize from within Elisp-code!

5.1.2.1 Storing all option-settings in the users custom-file
............................................................

The mechanism described here defines all site-wide-settings in a file
'site-lisp.el' but stores the values in the users 'custom-file' which is
probably '.emacs'!

First two helper functions are needed, namely
'customize-option-get-value' and 'customize-save-variable-save' whereas
the latter one sets the value for an option via the customize-mechanism
(and is therefore allowed for the setq-forbidden options!)  but only if
the option has no saved value until now (i.e.  the user has not saved
this option for future sessions until now)

     (defun customize-option-get-value (option type)
       "Return the value of a customizable option OPTION with TYPE, where TYPE
     can either be 'standard-value \(the default-value of the defcustom) or
     'saved-value \(the value stored durable by the user via customize)."
       (let ((val (car (get option type))))
         (cond ((not (listp val)) val)
               ((equal 'quote (car val)) (car (cdr val)))
               (t (car val)))))

     (defun customize-save-variable-save (option value &optional override)
       "Calls `customize-save-variable' with OPTION and VALUE if OPTION is a
     custom-type and if OPTION has no saved-value until now.
     If OVERRIDE is a function or lambda-form then it is called with two arguments:
     - OLD-SAVED-VAL: The saved value of OPTION
     - NEW-VALUE: see argument VALUE.
     OVERRIDE is only called if OPTION has already a saved-value. If OVERIDE
     returns not nil then `customize-save-variable' is called for OPTION with VALUE
     even if OPTION has no saved-value until now."
       (and (get option 'custom-type)
            (or (not (get option 'saved-value))
                (and (functionp override)
                     (funcall override
                              (customize-option-get-value option 'saved-value)
                              value)))
            (progn
              (message "Overriding saved value for option %s with %s" option value)
              (customize-save-variable option value))))

With 'customize-save-variable-save' all ECB-options can be site-wide
pre-customized like follows:

     (customize-save-variable-save 'ecb-show-tags
                                   '((include collapsed nil)
                                     (parent collapsed nil)
                                     (type flattened nil)
                                     (variable collapsed name)
                                     (function flattened name)
                                     (rule flattened name)
                                     (section flattened nil)
                                     (def collapsed name)
                                     (t collapsed name)))
     (customize-save-variable-save 'ecb-font-lock-tags t)
     ;; add here more options of ECB it you want

5.1.2.2 Using a special setq for site-wide settings
...................................................

The mechanism above saves the pre-customized values always in the users
'custom-file' (probably '.emacs').  If this is not preferred, then you
can use the following mechanism but of course the offered 'setq-save' is
only allowed for options which are not setq-forbidden (*note setq or
customize::).

The mechanism below does not change the users 'custom-file'.  This
mechanism is needed especially if ECB should be autoloaded and all
site-wide settings should first loaded when ECB is activated by the
user.  This can be achieved for example via(2):

     (require 'ecb-autoloads))
     (eval-after-load "ecb"
       '(require 'site-ecb))

In such a situation the whole 'custom-file' of a user is mostly loaded
*before* ECB is activated and therefore before the site-wide-settings
are loaded.  So the users own customizations are loaded before the
site-wide ones.

The 'setq-save'-mechanism described below prevents the users own
customisations contained in his 'custom-file' from being overridden by
the site-wide setq-settings.  If 'setq' would be used for the site-wide
settings then in an autoload-situation the site-wide settings would
override the users-settings and this should not be done!

First two helper-macros are needed:

     (defmacro custom-saved-p (option)
       "Return only not nil if OPTION is a defcustom-option and has a
     saved value. Option is a variable and is literal \(not evaluated)."
       `(and (get (quote ,option) 'custom-type)
             (get (quote ,option) 'saved-value)))

     (defmacro setq-save (option value)
       "Sets OPTION to VALUE if and only if OPTION is not already saved
     by customize. Option is a variable and is literal \(not evaluated)."
       `(and (not (custom-saved-p ,option))
             (set (quote ,option) ,value)))

With 'setq-save' all "not-setq-forbidden"-ECB-options can be site-wide
pre-customized like follows:

     (setq-save ecb-tree-indent 4)
     (setq-save ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before t)
     (setq-save ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons 'mouse-1--mouse-2)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) At least for the options for which 'setq' is explicitly
forbidden, but it is recommended to use always such a mechanism

   (2) The file 'site-ecb.el' contains all site-wide settings for ECB

5.2 The most important options of ECB
=====================================

Here are the most important options (it is recommended to check at least
the following options before working with ECB). You can customize them
via the customize-group "ecb-most-important" or via the command
'ecb-customize-most-important'.

'ecb-source-path'
     Where ECB can find your sources.  You must set this option!
'ecb-show-help-format'
     Should the online help of ECB be displayed in the standard Info
     format or in HTML format in a web-browser.
'ecb-auto-activate'
'ecb-major-modes-show-or-hide'
     Auto.  activation of ECB after start (*note Automatic activation::)
     or major-mode-based showing or hiding the ecb-windows.
'ecb-winman-escreen-number'
'ecb-winman-winring-name'
     Support of several window-managers (*note Window-managers and
     ECB::).
'ecb-key-map'
     All ECB-keybindings incl.  a common prefix-key (*note Using the
     keyboard::).
'ecb-new-ecb-frame'
     Should ECB create a new frame at activation time.
'ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons'
'ecb-mouse-click-destination'
     Define how to use the mouse (*note Using the mouse::).
'ecb-tree-buffer-style'
'ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'
'ecb-tree-indent'
'ecb-truncate-lines'
     The look&feel of the trees in the tree-buffers.  The former option
     defines the general style of the tree-buffers and the latter ones
     allow to customize the ascii-style tree-buffers (maybe you like a
     value of 4 for the latter one if you display the expand-symbol
     before (*note Tree-buffer styles::).
'ecb-source-file-regexps'
     Which files will (not) be shown in ECB.
'ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer'
     When and which node-info should be displayed in the minibuffer?
'ecb-layout-name'
'ecb-compile-window-height'
'ecb-compile-window-width'
'ecb-other-window-behavior'
     The ECB layout, means which windows you want to be displayed in the
     ECB-frame and also the location of these windows (*note Changing
     the ECB-layout::).
'ecb-compilation-buffer-names'
     Which buffers should be treaten as "compilation-buffers" and
     therefore displayed in the compile-window of ECB - if there is any.
'ecb-tag-display-function'
'ecb-type-tag-display'
'ecb-type-tag-expansion'
'ecb-show-tags'
     How to display the entries in the ECB-method window for semantic
     supported sources (*note Customizing the display::).  These options
     take only effect for semantic-sources (*note Definition of
     semantic- and non-semantic-sources::).
'ecb-process-non-semantic-files'
     Displaying file-contents for not by semantic supported files too,
     e.g.  for LaTeX- and perl-sources (*note Non-semantic sources::).

But to make ECB working best for you it is also recommended to have a
look at *note Customizable options::!

5.3 All customizable options of ECB
===================================

All customization of ECB is divided into the following "customize
groups".  You can highly customize all the ECB behavior/layout so just
go to these groups and you will see all well documented ECB-options.

*Please note*: All options in the following subsections are listed
without the prefix "ecb-" (e.g.  the option 'ecb-layout-name' is listed
with name "layout-name").  This has been done for a better readable
option index.  *Note Option Index::.

File: ecb.info,  Node: ecb-general,  Next: ecb-tree-buffer,  Prev: Customizable options,  Up: Customizable options

5.3.1 Group ecb-general
-----------------------

This group contains general settings for the Emacs code browser:

 -- User Option: activate-before-layout-draw-hook
     Normal hook run at the end of activating the ecb-package by running
     'ecb-activate'.  This hooks are run after all the internal setup
     process but directly before(!)  drawing the layout specified in
     'ecb-layout' (means before dividing the frame into several
     windows).

     A senseful using of this hook can be maximizing the Emacs-frame for
     example, because this should be done before the layout is drawn
     because ECB computes the size of the ECB-windows with the current
     frame size!  If you need a hook-option for the real end of the
     activating process (i.e.  after the layout-drawing) look at
     'ecb-activate-hook'.

     IMPORTANT: The difference between this hook and
     'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook' is that the latter one is evaluated
     always before the layout is redrawn (for example after calling
     'ecb-redraw-layout') whereas the former one (this hook) is only
     evaluated exactly once during the activation-process of ECB. So
     during the activation process there is the following sequence of
     hooks:
       1. 'ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook' \(this one)
       2. 'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'
       3. <Drawing the layout>
       4. 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
       5. 'ecb-activate-hook'

 -- User Option: activate-hook
     Hook run at the end of activating ECB by 'ecb-activate'.  This
     hooks are run at the real end of the activating process, means
     after the layout has been drawn!.  If you need hooks which are run
     direct before the layout-drawing look at
     'ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook'.

 -- User Option: activation-selects-ecb-frame-if-already-active
     Trying to activate an already activated ECB selects the ECB-frame.
     If t then the ECB-frame is selected, if nil then it is not.  If
     'ask then ECB asks if the ECB-frame should be selected if the
     current-frame is not the 'ecb-frame'.

 -- User Option: auto-activate
     Automatically startup ECB when Emacs starts up.  This should only
     be true if you always want to run 'ecb-activate'.

 -- User Option: auto-compatibility-check
     Check at ECB-startup if all ECB-options have correct values.  If
     not nil then all ECB-options are checked if their current value
     have the correct type.  It the type is incorrect the option is
     either auto.  upgraded to the new type or reset to the
     default-value of current ECB if no upgrade is possible.  This
     feature can also upgrade options which are renamed in current ECB
     and try to transform the old-value to the new named option.  After
     startup all upgraded or reset options are displayed with their old
     (before upgrade/reset) and new values.  See also the commands
     'ecb-upgrade-options' and 'ecb-display-upgraded-options'.  If this
     option is off then the user can perform the check and reset
     manually with 'ecb-upgrade-options'.  *Note Auto.
     option-upgrading::.

 -- User Option: before-activate-hook
     Normal hook run at the beginning of activating the ecb-package by
     running 'ecb-activate'.  These hooks run before any other tasks of
     the activating process are performed.  If any of these hooks
     returns nil then ECB will not be activated!

     This can be used to check some conditions and then only start ECB
     if all conditions are true.  For example a function could be added
     which returns only nil if Gnus is running.  Then calling
     'ecb-activate' or 'ecb-minor-mode' will only start ECB if Gnus is
     not already running.

 -- User Option: before-deactivate-hook
     Normal hook run at the beginning of deactivating ECB by running
     'ecb-deactivate'.  These hooks run before any other tasks of the
     deactivating process are performed.  If any of these hooks returns
     nil then ECB will not be deactivated!  See also
     'ecb-before-activate-hook'.

 -- User Option: bucket-node-display
     How ECB displays bucket-nodes in a ECB tree-buffer.  Bucket-nodes
     have only one job: Nodes with similar properties will be dropped
     into one bucket for such a common property and all these nodes will
     be added as children to the bucket-node.  Besides being expandable
     and collapsable a bucket-node has no senseful action assigned.
     Examples for bucket-nodes are "[+] Variables, "[+] Dependencies"
     etc.  in the Methods-buffer or buckets which combine filenames with
     same extension under a bucket-node with name this extension.

     This option defines how bucket-node should be displayed.  The name
     of the bucket-node is computed by ECB but you can define a prefix,
     a suffix and a special face for the bucket-node

     The default are empty prefix/suffix-strings and
     'ecb-bucket-node-face'.  But an alternative can be for example
     '("[" "]" nil) which means no special face and a display like "[+]
     [<bucket-name>]".

 -- User Option: clear-caches-before-activate
     Clear all ECB internal caches before startup.  If t then ECB clears
     all its internal caches before starting up.  Caches are used for
     files- and subdirs (see 'ecb-cache-directory-contents' and
     'ecb-cache-directory-contents-not') for semantic-tags and for the
     history-filter.

     This caches are completely clean at load-time of the ECB-library!

     Default is nil, because is makes sense not to clear these caches at
     start-time because ECB is often deacticated temporally especially
     in combination with window-managers like escreen.el.  In these
     situations the internal state of ECB should be preserved for next
     activation.

 -- User Option: current-buffer-sync-hook
     Normal hook run at the end of 'ecb-current-buffer-sync'.

     See documentation of 'ecb-current-buffer-sync' for conditions when
     synchronization takes place and so in turn these hooks are
     evaluated.

     Precondition for such a hook: Current buffer is the buffer of the
     current selected edit-window.

     Postcondition for such a hook: Point must stay in the same
     edit-window as before evaluating the hook.

     Important note: If 'ecb-window-sync' is not nil
     'ecb-current-buffer-sync' is running either every time Emacs is
     idle or even after every command (see 'ecb-window-sync-delay').  So
     these hooks can be really called very often!  Therefore each
     function of this hook should/must check in an efficient way at
     beginning if its task have to be really performed and then do them
     only if really necessary!  Otherwise performance of Emacs could
     slow down dramatically!

     It is strongly recommended that each function added to this hook
     uses the macro 'ecb-do-if-buffer-visible-in-ecb-frame' at
     beginning!  See 'ecb-speedbar-current-buffer-sync' and
     'ecb-eshell-current-buffer-sync' for examples how to use this
     macro!

 -- User Option: deactivate-hook
     Normal hook run at the end of deactivating (but before the
     ecb-layout is cleared!)  ECB by running 'ecb-deactivate'.

 -- User Option: debug-mode
     If not nil ECB displays debug-information in the Messages-buffer.
     This is done for some critical situations concerning semantic-tags
     and their overlays (or extends for XEmacs).  Normally you should
     not need this switched on!  But if you get errors like "destroyed
     extend" for XEmacs or "wrong-argument-type" concerning overlays for
     GNU Emacs then you should switch on this option and submitting a
     bug-report to the ecb-mailing-list ('ecb-submit-problem-report')
     after getting the error again!

 -- User Option: grep-function
     Function used for performing a grep.  The popup-menu of the
     tree-buffers "Directories", "Sources" and "History" offer to grep
     the "current" directory:
        - Directory-buffer: The grep is performed in the current
          popup-directory after clicking the right mouse-button onto a
          node.
        - Sources-buffer: The grep is performed in the current selected
          directory.
        - History-buffer: The grep is performed in the directory of the
          current popup-source after clicking the right mouse-button
          onto a node.

 -- User Option: grep-find-function
     Function used for performing a recursive grep.  For more Details
     see option 'ecb-grep-function' and replace "grep" with "recursive
     grep".

 -- User Option: key-map
     Specifies all keybindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map.  The
     value is a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all
     the keybindings.  The cdr is a list of keybindings each of them a
     list again.  A key-binding has the following form:

          '(<common-prefix-flag> <keysequence> <function>) where

     '<common-prefix-flag>'
          If t then the common-prefix-key defined as car of the value
          (see above) is used.

     '<keysequence>'
          If the common prefix-key is used then the final key-binding is
          the concatenation of the common-prefix-key (see above) and
          this keysequence.

     '<function>:'
          The function to bind to the key.  This can also be a
          lambda-expression .

     It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x
     as first key of your common-prefix-key!

     You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

     All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the
     syntax needed by 'read-kbd-macro' or 'kbd'.  This means you can
     insert the key in the same manner 'C-h k' displays keysequences.
     Here is the summary of the syntax:

     Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace.  Except for
     the words described below, the characters of each word go directly
     as characters of the keysequence.  The whitespace that separates
     words is ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written
     explicitly, as in 'C-c SPC'.

        * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL
          represent special control characters.  The words must be
          written in uppercase.

        * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, <left> or
          <f1>, represents a function key.  (Note that in the standard
          configuration, the function key <return> and the control key
          RET are synonymous.).  You can use angle brackets on the words
          RET, SPC, etc., but they are not required there.

        * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash
          followed by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to
          represent keys with codes above .

        * One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A-
          (alt), H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or
          key notation.  For function keys, the prefixes may go inside
          or outside of the brackets: C-<down> = <C-down>.  The prefixes
          may be written in any order: M-C-x = C-M-x.  Prefixes are not
          allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except that the Meta
          prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional minus
          sign: M-123 = M- M-1 M-2 M-3.

        * The '^' notation for control characters also works: ^M = C-m.

 -- User Option: major-modes-show-or-hide
     List of major-modes which show or hide the ecb-windows.  The value
     is a cons-cell where the car contains all major-mode-symbols which
     should show the special ecb-windows and the cdr contains all
     major-mode-symbols which should hide the special ecb-windows.  If
     the symbol of a major-mode is neither contained in the
     car-"show-list" nor in the cdr-"hide-list" then the
     visibility-state of the ecb-windows does not change.

 -- User Option: minor-mode-text
     String to display in the mode line when ECB minor mode is active.
     (When the string is not empty, make sure that it has a leading
     space.)

     Because for ECB it is quite obvious if it is active or not when the
     ECB-windows are visible this text is only display in the modeline
     if the ECB-windows are hidden.

 -- User Option: mouse-click-destination
     Destination of a mouse-button click.  Defines in which edit-window
     (if splitted) ECB does the "right" action (opening a source,
     jumping to a method/variable etc.)  after clicking with the primary
     mouse-button (see 'ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons') onto a
     node.  There are two possible choices:

        - 'left-top': Does the "right" action always in the left/topmost
          edit-window.
        - 'last-point': Does the "right" action always in that
          edit-window which had the point before.
     This is if the user has clicked either with the primary
     mouse-button or has activated a popup-menu in the tree-buffer.

     If the edit-area is not splitted this setting doesn't matter.

     A click with the secondary mouse-button (see again
     'ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons' does the "right" action
     always in another edit-window related to the setting in this
     option: If there are two edit-windows then the "other" edit-window
     is used and for more than 2 edit-windows the "next" edit-window is
     used (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is the
     first edit-window).

     Note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead with
     the mouse then this option takes effect too because 'RET' is
     interpreted as primary mouse-button and 'C-RET' as secondary
     mouse-button!

 -- User Option: run-ediff-in-ecb-frame
     Run ediff-sessions in the same frame as ECB is running.  If not nil
     then ECB ensures that ediff runs in the same frame as ECB and ECB
     restores exactly the "before-ediff"-window-layout after quiting
     ediff.  If nil then ediff decides in which frame it will run -
     depending on the current window-layout (e.g.  if the ecb-windows
     are currently hidden) this can be the ecb-frame but this can also
     be a newly created frame or any other frame.

 -- User Option: tip-of-the-day
     Show tip of the day at start time of ECB.

 -- User Option: tip-of-the-day-file
     File where tip-of-the-day cursor is stored.

 -- User Option: use-recursive-edit
     Tell ECB to use a recursive edit.  If set then it can easily be
     deactivated by (keyboard-escape-quit).

 -- User Option: version-check
     Checks at start-time if the requirements are fulfilled.  It checks
     if the required versions of the libraries semantic, eieio and
     speedbar are installed and loaded into Emacs.

     It is strongly recommended to set this option to not 'nil'!

 -- User Option: window-sync
     Synchronize the ECB-windows automatically with current edit window.
     If 'always' then the synchronization takes place always a buffer
     changes in the edit window, if 'nil' then never.  If a list of
     major-modes then only if the 'major-mode' of the new buffer belongs
     NOT to this list.

     But in every case the synchronization takes only place if the
     current-buffer in the current active edit-window has a relation to
     files or directories.  Examples for the former one are all
     programming-language-modes, 'Info-mode' too, an example for the
     latter one is 'dired-mode'.  For all major-modes related to
     non-file/directory-buffers like 'help-mode', 'customize-mode' and
     others never an autom.  synchronization will be done!

     It's recommended to exclude at least 'Info-mode' because it makes
     no sense to synchronize the ECB-windows after calling the Info
     help.  Per default also 'dired-mode' is excluded but it can also
     making sense to synchronize the ECB-directories/sources windows
     with the current directory in the dired-buffer.

     IMPORTANT NOTE: Every time the synchronization is done the hook
     'ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook' is evaluated.

 -- User Option: window-sync-delay
     Time Emacs must be idle before the ECB-windows are synchronized
     with current edit window.  If nil then there is no delay, means
     synchronization takes place immediately.  A small value of about
     0.25 seconds saves CPU resources and you get even though almost the
     same effect as if you set no delay.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ecb-tree-buffer,  Next: ecb-directories,  Prev: ecb-general,  Up: Customizable options

5.3.2 Group ecb-tree-buffer
---------------------------

This group contains general settings related to the tree-buffers of ECB:

 -- User Option: common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running at the end of each tree-buffer creation.  Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating a tree-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map.  So for
     example a function could be added which performs calls of
     'local-set-key' to define new keybindings for EVERY tree-buffer.

     The following keys must not be rebind in all tree-buffers:
        - 'RET' and all combinations with 'Shift' and 'Ctrl'
        - 'TAB'
        - 'C-t'

 -- User Option: primary-secondary-mouse-buttons
     Primary- and secondary mouse button for using the ECB-buffers.  A
     click with the primary button causes the main effect in each
     ECB-buffer:

        * ECB Directories: Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying
          files in the ECB Sources buffer.

        * ECB sources/history: Opening the file in that edit-window
          specified by the option 'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

        * ECB Methods: Jumping to the method in that edit-window
          specified by the option 'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

     A click with the primary mouse-button while the SHIFT-key is
     pressed called the POWER-click and does the following (depending on
     the ECB-buffer where the POWER-click occurs):

        * ECB Directories: Refreshing the directory-contents-cache (see
          'ecb-cache-directory-contents').

        * ECB sources/history: Only displaying the source-contents in
          the method-buffer but not displaying the source-file in the
          edit-window.

        * ECB Methods: Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect...
          (see 'ecb-tag-visit-post-actions').  This works only for
          semantic supported sources but not for imenu- or
          etags-supported ones!

     In addition always the whole node-name is displayed in the
     minibuffer after a POWER-click \(for this see also
     'ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer').

     The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in
     another edit-window (see the documentation
     'ecb-mouse-click-destination').

     The following combinations are possible:

        - primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2 (means mouse-2 while
          CTRL-key is pressed).  This is the default setting.
        - primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1
        - primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2

     Please note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead
     with the mouse then 'RET' is interpreted as primary mouse-button
     and 'C-RET' as secondary mouse-button!

     If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
     activate ECB again to take effect

 -- User Option: show-node-info-in-minibuffer
     Node info to display in a tree-buffer.  Define which node info
     should displayed in a tree-buffer after mouse moving over the node
     or after a shift click onto the node.

     For every tree-buffer you can define "when" node info should be
     displayed:

        - 'always': Node info is displayed by moving with the mouse over
          a node.
        - 'if-too-long': Node info is only displayed by moving with the
          mouse over a node does not fit into the window-width of the
          tree-buffer window.  In the ECB directories buffer this means
          also if a node is shortened or if the node has an alias (see
          'ecb-source-path').
        - 'shift-click': Node info is only displayed after a shift click
          with the primary mouse button onto the node.
        - 'never': Node info is never displayed.

     For every tree-buffer you can define what info should be displayed:

        * Directory-buffer:
             - 'name': Only the full node-name is displayed.
             - 'path': The full-path of the node is displayed.

        * Sources-buffer:
             - 'name': Only the full node-name is displayed.
             - 'file-info': File infos for this file are displayed.
             - 'file-info-full': Fill infos incl.  full path for this
               file are displayed.
        * History-buffer: see Directories-buffer.
        * Methods-buffer:
             - 'name': Only the full node name is displayed.
             - 'name+type': The full name + the type of the node
               (function, class, variable) is displayed.

     Do NOT set this option directly via setq but use always customize!

 -- User Option: tree-RET-selects-edit-window
     In which tree-buffers RET should finally select an edit-window.  If
     a name of an ECB tree-buffer is contained in this list then hitting
     RET in this tree-buffer selects as last action the right
     edit-window otherwise only the right action is performed (opening a
     new source, selecting a method etc.)  but point stays in the
     tree-buffer.

     A special remark for the 'ecb-directories-buffer-name': Of course
     here the edit-window is only selected if
     'ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is not nil (otherwise this
     would not make any sense)!

     The setting in this option is only the default for each
     tree-buffer.  With 'ecb-toggle-RET-selects-edit-window' the
     behavior of RET can be changed fast and easy in a tree-buffer
     without customizing this option, but of course not for future Emacs
     sessions!

 -- User Option: tree-buffer-style
     The style of the tree-buffers.  There are three different styles
     available:

     Image-style (value 'image'): Very nice and modern - just try it.
     For this style the options 'ecb-tree-indent' and
     'ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before' have no effect!  Note: GNU Emacs <=
     21.3.X for Windows does not support image-display so ECB uses
     always 'ascii-guides even when here 'image is set!

     Ascii-style with guide-lines (value 'ascii-guides'):
          [-] ECB
           |  [+] code-save
           `- [-] ecb-images
               |  [-] directories
               |   |  [-] height-15
               |   |   |  * close.xpm
               |   |   |  * empty.xpm
               |   |   |  * leaf.xpm
               |   |   `- * open.xpm
               |   |  [+] height-17
               |   |  [+] height-19
               |   `- [+] height-21
               |  [x] history
               |  [x] methods
               `- [x] sources

     Ascii-style without guide-lines (value 'ascii-no-guides') - this is
     the style used by ECB <= 1.96:
          [-] ECB
              [+] code-save
              [-] ecb-images
                  [-] directories
                      [-] height-15
                          * close.xpm
                          * empty.xpm
                          * leaf.xpm
                          * open.xpm
                      [+] height-17
                      [+] height-19
                      [+] height-21
                  [x] history
                  [x] methods
                  [x] sources

     With both ascii-styles the tree-layout can be affected with the
     options 'ecb-tree-indent' and 'ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'.

 -- User Option: tree-easy-hor-scroll
     Scroll step for easy hor.  scrolling via mouse-click in
     tree-buffers.  XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible parts
     beyond the right window-border of a tree-buffer can always made
     visible very easy.

     GNU Emacs does not have hor.  scroll-bars so especially with the
     mouse it is quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left.
     The functions 'scroll-left' and 'scroll-right' can be annoying and
     are also not bound to mouse-buttons.

     If this option is a positive integer S then in all ECB-tree-buffers
     the keys 'M-mouse-1' and 'M-mouse-3' are bound to scrolling left
     rsp.  right with scroll-step S - clicking with 'mouse-1' or
     'mouse-2' onto the edge of the modeline has the same effect, i.e.
     if you click with mouse-1 onto the left (rsp right) edge of the
     modeline you will scroll left (rsp.  right).

     Additionally 'C-M-mouse-1' and 'C-M-mouse-3' are bound to scrolling
     left rsp.  right with scroll-step 'window-width' - 2.

     Default is a scroll-step of 5.  If the value is 'nil' then no keys
     for horizontal scrolling are bound.

 -- User Option: tree-expand-symbol-before
     Show the expand symbol before the items in a tree.  When the
     expand-symbol is located before the items then the tree looks like:

          [-] ECB
              [+] code-save
              [-] ecb-images
                  [-] directories

     When located after then the tree looks like:

          ECB [-]
            code-save [+]
            ecb-images [-]
              directories [-]

     The after-example above use a value of 2 for 'ecb-tree-indent'
     whereas the before-example uses a value of 4.

     It is recommended to display the expand-symbol before because
     otherwise it could be that with a deep nested item-structure with
     and/or with long item-names (e.g.  a deep directory-structure with
     some long subdirectory-names) the expand-symbol is not visible in
     the tree-buffer and the tree-buffer has to be horizontal scrolled
     to expand an item.

 -- User Option: tree-image-icons-directories
     Directories where the images for the tree-buffer can be found.
     This is a five-element list where:
       1. element: Default directory where the default images for the
          tree-buffer can be found.  It should contain an image for
          every name of 'tree-buffer-tree-image-names'.  The name of an
          image-file must be: "ecb-<NAME of
          TREE-BUFFER-TREE-IMAGE-NAMES>.<ALLOWED EXTENSIONS>".
       2. element: Directory for special images for the
          Directories-buffer.
       3. element: Directory for special images for the Sources-buffer.
       4. element: Directory for special images for the Methods-buffer.
       5. element: Directory for special images for the History-buffer.

     The directories of the element 2 - 5 are additional
     image-directories which are searched first for images needed for
     the respective tree-buffer.  If the image can not be found in this
     directory then the default-directory (1.  element) is searched.  If
     the image can't even found there the related ascii-symbol is used.

     All but the first element (the default directory) can be nil.

     ECB comes with images in four diffenent heights - so for the most
     senseful font-heights of a tree-buffer a fitting image-size should
     be available.  The images reside either in the subdirectory
     "ecb-images" of the ECB-installation or - if ECB is installed as
     regular XEmacs-package - in the ECB-etc data-directory.

 -- User Option: tree-incremental-search
     Enable incremental search in the ECB-tree-buffers.  For a detailed
     explanation see the online help section "Working with the keyboard
     in the ECB buffers".  If you change this during ECB is activated
     you must deactivate and activate ECB again to take effect.

 -- User Option: tree-indent
     Indent size for tree buffer.  If you change this during ECB is
     activated you must deactivate and activate ECB again to take
     effect.

 -- User Option: tree-navigation-by-arrow
     Enable smart navigation in the tree-windows by horiz.  arrow-keys.
     If not nil then the left- and right-arrow keys work in the ECB
     tree-window in the following smart way if onto an expandable node:

        * Left-arrow: If node is expanded then it will be collapsed
          otherwise point jumps to the next "higher" node in the
          hierarchical tree (higher means the next higher tree-level or
          - if no higher level available - the next higher node on the
          same level).

        * Right-arrow: If node is not expanded then it will be expanded.
          Onto a not expandable node the horizontal arrow-keys go one
          character in the senseful correct direction.

     If this option is changed the new value takes first effect after
     deactivating ECB and then activating it again!

 -- User Option: truncate-lines
     Truncate lines in ECB buffers.  If you change this during ECB is
     activated you must deactivate and activate ECB again to take
     effect.

 -- User Option: truncate-long-names
     Truncate long names that don't fit in the width of the ECB windows.
     If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
     activate ECB again to take effect.

5.3.3 Group ecb-directories
---------------------------

This group contains settings for the directories-buffer in the ECB:

 -- User Option: add-path-for-not-matching-files
     Add path of a file to 'ecb-source-path' if not already contained.
     This is done during the auto.  windows synchronization which
     happens if a file is opened not via the file/directory-browser of
     ECB. In such a situation ECB adds the path of the new file auto.
     to 'ecb-source-path' at least temporally for the current Emacs
     session.  This option defines two things:

       1. Should only the root-part (which means for Unix-like systems
          always '/' and for windows-like systems the drive) of the new
          file be added as source-path to 'ecb-source-path' or the whole
          directory-part?
       2. Should this path be added for future sessions too?

     The value of this option is a cons-cell where the car is a boolean
     for 1.  and the cdr is a boolean for 2.

     A value of not nil for the car (1.)  is reasonably if a user often
     opens files not via the ECB-browser which are not located in any of
     the paths of 'ecb-source-path' because then only one path for each
     drive (windows) or the root-path (Unix) is added to the directory
     buffer of ECB.

 -- User Option: auto-expand-directory-tree
     Automatically expand the directory tree to the current source file.
     There are three options:

        - 'best': Expand the best-matching source-path
        - 'first': Expand the first matching source-path
        - 'nil': Do not automatically expand the directory tree.

 -- User Option: cache-directory-contents
     Cache contents of directories.

     This can be useful if 'ecb-source-path' contains directories with
     many files and subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted
     net-drives ("many" means here something > 500, dependent of the
     speed of the net-connection and the machine).  For these
     directories actualizing the sources- and/or directories- buffer of
     ECB (if displayed in current layout!)  can slow down dramatically
     so a caching increases speed a lot.

     The value of this option is a list where each element is a
     cons-cell and looks like:

            (<dir-regexp> . <filenumber threshold>) with

     '<dir-regexp>:'
          Regular expression a directory must match to be cached.
     '<filenumber threshold>:'
          Number of directory contents must exceed this number.

     A directory will only be cached if and only if the directory-name
     matches at least one rexexp of this option and its content-number
     exceeds the related threshold AND the directory-name matches NOT
     any regexp of 'ecb-cache-directory-contents-not'!

     The cache entry for a certain directory will be refreshed and
     actualized only by using the POWER-click (see
     'ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons') in the directories-buffer of
     ECB (*note Using the mouse::).

     Examples:

     A value of '(("/usr/home/john_smith/bigdir*" . 1000))' means the
     contents of every subdirectory of the home-directory of John Smith
     will be cached if the directory contains more than 1000 entries and
     its name begins with "bigdir".

     A value of '((".*" . 1000))' caches every directory which has more
     than 1000 entries.

     A value of '((".*" . 0))' caches every directory regardless of the
     number of entries."

     Please note: If you want your home-dir being cached then you MUST
     NOT use "~" because ECB tries always to match full path-names!

 -- User Option: cache-directory-contents-not
     Do not cache the contents of certain directories.  The value of
     this option is a list where the each element is a regular
     expression a directory must match if it should not being cached.

     If a directory-name matches at least one of the regexps of this
     option the directory-contents will never being cached.  See
     'ecb-cache-directory-contents' to see when a directory will be
     cached.

     This option can be useful when normally all directories with a
     certain amount of content (files and subdirs) should be cached but
     some special directories not.  This can be achieved by:

        - Setting 'ecb-cache-directory-contents' to ((".*" .  500)):
          Caches all directories with more then 500 entries

        - Setting 'ecb-cache-directory-contents-not' to a value which
          matches these directories which should not being cached (e.g.
          ("/usr/home/john_smith") excludes the HOME-directory of John
          Smith from being cached).

     Please note: If you want your home-dir exclude from being cached
     then you MUST NOT use "~" because ECB tries always to match full
     path-names!

 -- User Option: directories-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running after the creation of the directories-buffer.
     Every function of this hook is called once without arguments direct
     after creating the directories-buffer of ECB and it's local
     key-map.  So for example a function could be added which performs
     calls of 'local-set-key' to define new keybindings only for the
     directories-buffer of ECB.

     The following keys must not be rebind in the directories-buffer:
     'F2', 'F3' and 'F4'

 -- User Option: directories-buffer-name
     Name of the ECB directory buffer.  Because it is not a normal
     buffer for editing you should enclose the name with stars, e.g.  "
     *ECB Directories*".

     If it is necessary for you you can get emacs-lisp access to the
     buffer-object of the ECB-directory-buffer by this name, e.g.  by a
     call of 'set-buffer'.

     Changes for this option at runtime will take affect only after
     deactivating and then activating ECB again!

 -- User Option: directories-menu-sorter
     Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

     If a function then this function is called to re-arrange the
     menu-entries of the combined menu-entries of the
     user-menu-extensions of 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension' and
     the built-in-menu 'ecb-directories-menu'.  If nil then no special
     sorting will be done and the user-extensions are placed in front of
     the built-in-entries.

     The function get one argument, a list of menu-entries.  For the
     format of this argument see 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'.
     The function must return a new list in the same format.  Of course
     this function can not only re-arrange the entries but also delete
     entries or add new entries.

 -- User Option: directories-menu-user-extension
     Static user extensions for the popup-menu of the directories
     buffer.  Value is a list of elements of the following type: Each
     element defines a new menu-entry and is either:

       1. Menu-command: A list containing two sub-elements, whereas the
          first is the function (a function symbol) being called if the
          menu-entry is selected and the second is the name of the
          menu-entry.

       2. Separator: A one-element-list and the element is the string
          "--": Then a non-selectable menu-separator is displayed.

       3. Submenu: A list where the first element is the title of the
          submenu displayed in the main-menu and all other elements are
          either menu-commands (see 1) or separators (see 2) or another
          submenu (see c).  This allows deep nested
          menu-submenu-structures.  Currently a level of 4 is allowed
          but in general there could be an infinite depth of nesting but
          it makes no sense - if possible at all - to define infinite
          nested defcustom-types.  So there is a limit of 4 levels but
          tis is not a hard limit: Just increase the value of the
          'ecb-max-submenu-depth' *BEFORE* first loading ECB!

     The function of a menu-command must follow the following
     guidelines: Such a function must be defined with the macro
     'tree-buffer-defpopup-command'!  This macro defines a new
     popup-command whereas the newly defined command gets one argument
     NODE.  See the docstring of 'tree-buffer-defpopup-command' for
     further details.

     Example for the definition of such a menu-function:

          (tree-buffer-defpopup-command ecb-my-special-dir-popup-function
            "Prints the name of the directory of the node under point."
            (let ((node-data=dir (tree-node-get-data node)))
               (message ``Dir under node: %s'' node-data=dir)))

     Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning
     of the built-in menu-entries of 'ecb-directories-menu' but the
     whole menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

     These menu-extensions are static.  A dynamic menu-extension can be
     achieved via 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension-function'.

 -- User Option: directories-menu-user-extension-function
     Dynamic user extensions for the popup-menu of the directories
     buffer.  A function which has to return a list in the same format
     like the option 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'.  This
     function is called when the user opens the popup-menu for the
     directories buffer.

     Per default the dynamic user-extensions are added in front of the
     static extensions of 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension' but the
     whole menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: display-default-dir-after-start
     Automatically display current default-directory after activating
     ECB.

     If a file-buffer is displayed in the current active edit-window
     then ECB synchronizes its tree-buffers to this file-buffer - at
     least if the option 'ecb-window-sync' it not nil.  So for this
     situation 'ecb-display-default-dir-after-start' takes no effect but
     this option is for the case if no file-buffer is displayed in the
     edit-window after startup:

     If true then ECB selects autom.  the current default-directory
     after activation even if no file-buffer is displayed in the current
     active edit-window.  This is useful if ECB is autom.  activated
     after startup of Emacs and Emacs is started without a
     file-argument.  So the directory from which the startup has
     performed is auto.  selected in the ECB-directories buffer and the
     ECB-sources buffer displays the contents of this directory.

 -- User Option: excluded-directories-regexp
     Directories that should not be included in the directories list.
     The value of this variable should be a regular expression.

 -- User Option: prescan-directories-for-emptyness
     ECB does this so directories are displayed as empty in the
     directories-buffer even without user-interaction (i.e.  in previous
     ECB-versions the emptyness of a directory has been first checked
     when the user has clicked onto a directory).  ECB optimizes this
     check as best as possible but if a directory contains a lot of
     subdirectories which contain in turn a lot of entries, then
     expanding such a directory or selecting it takes of course more
     time as without this check - at least at the first time (all
     following selects of a directory uses the cached information if its
     subdirectories are empty or not).  Therefore this feature can be
     switched of via this option."

 -- User Option: show-sources-in-directories-buffer
     Show source files in directories buffer.

 -- User Option: source-path
     Paths where to find code sources.  Each path can have an optional
     alias that is used as it's display name.  If no alias is set, the
     path is used as display name.

 -- User Option: use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer
     If true then uses speedbar for directories, sources or methods.
     This means that speedbar is integrated in the ECB-frame and is
     displayed in that window normally displaying the standard
     ECB-directories-buffer, ECB-sources-buffer or ECB-methods-buffer.

     This option takes effect in all layouts which contain either a
     directory window, a sources window or a method window.

     This option can have four valid values:
        - 'nil': Do not use speedbar (default)
        - 'dir': Use speedbar instead of the standard directories-buffer
        - 'source': Use speedbar instead of the standard sources-buffer
        - 'method': Use speedbar instead of the standard methods-buffer

     Note: For directories and sources a similar effect and usability is
     available by setting this option to 'nil' (or 'method') and setting
     'ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' to not 'nil', because this
     combination displays also directories and sources in one window.

     'ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is for people who
     like the speedbar way handling directories and source-files or
     methods and want it in conjunction with ECB.

5.3.4 Group ecb-sources
-----------------------

This group contains settings for the sources-buffer in the ECB:

 -- User Option: show-source-file-extension
     Show the file extension of source files.

 -- User Option: source-file-regexps
     Specifies which files are shown as source files.

     This is done on directory-base, which means for each
     directory-regexp the files to display can be specified.  If more
     than one directory-regexp matches the current selected directory
     then always the first one (and its related
     file-exclude/include-regexps) is used!  If no directory-regexp
     matches then all files are displayed for the currently selected
     directory.

     Important note: It is recommended that the *LAST* element of this
     list should contain an always matching directory-regexp ('".*"')!

     So the value of this option is a list of cons-cells where the car
     is a directory regexp and the cdr is a 2 element list where the
     first element is a exclude regexp and the second element is a
     include regexp.  A file is displayed in the source-buffer of ECB
     iff: The file does not match the exclude regexp OR the file matches
     the include regexp.

     But regardless of the value of this option a file F is never
     displayed in the sources-buffer if the directory matches
     'ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore' and the directory contains a file
     .cvsignore which contains F as an entry!

     There are three predefined and useful combinations of an exclude
     and include regexp:

        * All files

        * All, but no backup, object, lib or ini-files (except .emacs
          and .gnus).  This means all files except those starting with
          ".", "#" or ending with "~", ".elc", ".obj", ".o", ".lib",
          ".dll", ".a", ".so".  (but including .emacs and .gnus)

        * Common source file types (.c, .java etc.)

     In addition to these predefined values a custom exclude and include
     combination can be defined.

     Tips for the directory- and file-rexexps: '"$^"' matches no
     files/directories, '".*"' matches all files/directories.

 -- User Option: sources-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running after the creation of the sources-buffer.  Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating the sources-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map.  So for
     example a function could be added which performs calls of
     'local-set-key' to define new keybindings only for the
     sources-buffer of ECB.

 -- User Option: sources-buffer-name
     Name of the ECB sources buffer.  Because it is not a normal buffer
     for editing you should enclose the name with stars, e.g.  "*ECB
     Sources*".

     If it is necessary for you you can get emacs-lisp access to the
     buffer-object of the ECB-sources-buffer by this name, e.g.  by a
     call of 'set-buffer'.

     Changes for this option at runtime will take affect only after
     deactivating and then activating ECB again!

 -- User Option: sources-exclude-cvsignore
     Specify if files contained in a '.cvsignore' should be excluded.

     Value is a list of regular expressions or nil.  If you want to
     exclude files listed in a '.cvsignore'-file from being displayed in
     the ecb-sources-buffer then specify a regexp for such a directory.

     If you want to exclude the contents of '.cvsignore'-files for every
     directory then you should add one regexp ".*" which matches every
     directory.

     If you never want to exclude the contents of '.cvsignore'-files
     then set this option to nil.

 -- User Option: sources-menu-sorter
     Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

     If a function then this function is called to sort the menu-entries
     of the combined menu-entries of the user-menu-extensions of
     'ecb-sources-menu-user-extension' and the built-in-menu
     'ecb-sources-menu'.  If nil then no special sorting will be done
     and the user-extensions are placed in front of the
     built-in-entries.

     For the guidelines for such a sorter-function see
     'ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: sources-menu-user-extension
     Static user extensions for the popup-menu of the sources buffer.
     For further explanations see 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'.

     The node-argument of a menu-function contains as data the filename
     of the source for which the popup-menu has been opened.

     Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning
     of the built-in menu-entries of 'ecb-sources-menu' but the whole
     menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-sources-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: sources-menu-user-extension-function
     Dynamic user extensions for the popup-menu of the sources buffer.
     A function which has to return a list in the same format like the
     option 'ecb-sources-menu-user-extension'.  This function is called
     when the user opens the popup-menu for the sources buffer.

     Per default the dynamic user-extensions are added in front of the
     static extensions of 'ecb-sources-menu-user-extension' but the
     whole menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-sources-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: sources-sort-method
     Defines how the source files are sorted.

        - 'name': Sorting by name.
        - 'extension': Sorting first by name and then by extension.
        - 'nil': No sorting, means source files are displayed in the
          sequence returned by 'directory-files' (called without
          sorting).


File: ecb.info,  Node: ecb-methods,  Next: ecb-history,  Prev: ecb-sources,  Up: Customizable options

5.3.5 Group ecb-methods
-----------------------

This group contains settings for the methods-buffer in the ECB:

 -- User Option: auto-expand-tag-tree
     Expand the methods-tag-tree automatically if node invisible.

     This option has only an effect if option
     'ecb-highlight-tag-with-point' is switched on too.  There are three
     possible choices:
        - 'nil': No auto.  expanding of the method buffer.
        - 'expand-spec': Auto expand the method-buffer nodes if the node
          belonging to current tag under point is invisible because its
          parent-node is collapsed.  But expanding is only done if the
          type of the tag under point in the edit-buffer is contained in
          'ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec'.
        - 'all': Like expand-spec but expands all tags regardless of the
          setting in 'ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec'.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: auto-expand-tag-tree-collapse-other
     Auto.  expanding the tag-tree collapses all not related nodes.  If
     t then all nodes which have no relevance for the currently
     highlighted node will be collapsed, because they are not necessary
     to make the highlighted node visible.

 -- User Option: auto-update-methods-after-save
     Automatically updating the ECB method buffer after saving a source.

 -- User Option: default-tag-filter
     Default tag-filters for certain files.  This option allow to define
     default tag-filters for certain files which are applied
     automatically after loading such a file into a buffer.  The
     possible filters are the same as offered by the command
     'ecb-methods-filter' and they are applied in the same manner - the
     only difference is they are applied automatically.  Please be aware
     that symbol-filters (e.g.  protection-symbols like public or
     private) must not be inserted with quotes whereas a filter-regexp
     has to be inserted with surrounding double-quotes!  In addition
     backslashes in a regexp have to be doubled!

     For each file-spec (a major-mode plus a file-regexp which both
     specify a file for which filters should be applied) there can be as
     much filters as needed - they are layered like with
     'ecb-methods-filter' too.

     Tag-classes which are completely hidden or excluded by the option
     'ecb-show-tags' will never being displayed in the Methods-buffer
     regardless of the filters of this option!

 -- User Option: display-image-icons-for-semantic-tags
     Display nice and pretty icons for semantic-tags in the
     Methods-buffer.  This option takes only effect if Emacs can display
     images and if 'ecb-tree-buffer-style' is set to 'image'.

 -- User Option: exclude-parents-regexp
     Regexp which parent classes should not be shown in the methods
     buffer (see also 'ecb-show-parents').  If nil then all parents will
     be shown if 'ecb-show-parents' is not nil.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand
     Switch off auto expanding in the ECB-method buffer.  If on then
     auto expanding is switched off after explicit expanding or
     collapsing by 'ecb-expand-methods-nodes'.

     This is done with 'ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree' so after the
     switch off the auto expanding feature can again switched on
     quickly.

     But after explicitly expanding/collapsing the methods-buffer to a
     certain level the auto.  expanding could undo this when the node
     belonging to current tag under point in the current active
     edit-window is invisible after 'ecb-expand-methods-nodes' - then
     the auto.  expand feature would make this node immediately visible
     and destroys the explicitly set expand-level.

 -- User Option: font-lock-tags
     Adds font-locking (means highlighting) to the ECB-method buffer.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: highlight-tag-with-point
     How to highlight the method or variable under the cursor.

        - 'highlight-scroll': Always scroll the method buffer, so the
          current method of the edit-window is highlighted in the
          method-window.
        - 'highlight': Only highlight the current method of the edit
          window in the method window if the method is visible in the
          method-window.
        - 'nil': No highlighting is done.

     See also 'ecb-highlight-tag-with-point-delay'.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: highlight-tag-with-point-delay
     Time Emacs must be idle before current tag is highlighted.  If nil
     then there is no delay, means current tag is highlighted
     immediately.  A small value of about 0.25 seconds saves CPU
     resources and you get even though almost the same effect as if you
     set no delay.  But such a delay prevents also "jumping
     backward/forward" during scrolling within java-classes if point
     goes out of method-definition into class-definition.  Therefore the
     default value is a delay of 0.25 seconds.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: methods-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running after the creation of the methods-buffer.  Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating the methods-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map.  So for
     example a function could be added which performs calls of
     'local-set-key' to define new keybindings only for the
     methods-buffer of ECB.

 -- User Option: methods-buffer-name
     Name of the ECB methods buffer.  Because it is not a normal buffer
     for editing you should enclose the name with stars, e.g.  " *ECB
     Methods*".

     If it is necessary for you you can get emacs-lisp access to the
     buffer-object of the ECB-methods-buffer by this name, e.g.  by a
     call of 'set-buffer'.

     Changes for this option at runtime will take affect only after
     deactivating and then activating ECB again!

 -- User Option: methods-filter-replace-existing
     How the methods-filter should be applied to existing filters.
     There are three different choices:

        - 'never': This is the default and means that calling
          'ecb-methods-filter' always adds the new filter on top of
          already existing filters.  So you can combine several filter
          to one combined like this example: 'Display only all public
          methods having the string "test" in its name.'  With this
          setting the filters can only be cleared by calling
          'ecb-methods-filter' and then choosing "nothing".

        - 'always': This means that 'ecb-methods-filter' always clears a
          previous filter before applying the new one.

        - 'ask': ECB asks if the new filter should replace the existing
          ones.

 -- User Option: methods-menu-sorter
     Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

     If a function then this function is called to sort the menu-entries
     of the combined menu-entries of the user-menu-extensions of
     'ecb-methods-menu-user-extension' and the built-in-menu
     'ecb-methods-menu'.  If nil then no special sorting will be done
     and the user-extensions are placed in front of the
     built-in-entries.

     For the guidelines for such a sorter-function see
     'ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: methods-menu-user-extension
     Static user extensions for the popup-menu of the methods buffer.
     For further explanations see 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'.

     The node-argument of a menu-function contains as data the
     semantic-tag of the method/variable/tag for which the popup-menu
     has been opened.

     Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning
     of the built-in menu-entries of 'ecb-methods-menu' but the whole
     menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-methods-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: methods-menu-user-extension-function
     Dynamic user extensions for the popup-menu of the methods buffer.
     A function which has to return a list in the same format like the
     option 'ecb-methods-menu-user-extension'.  This function is called
     when the user opens the popup-menu for the methods buffer.  For an
     example how such a function can be programmed see
     'ecb-methods-menu-editwin-entries'.

     Per default the dynamic user-extensions are added in front of the
     static extensions of 'ecb-methods-menu-user-extension' but the
     whole menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-methods-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: methods-nodes-collapse-spec
     Semantic tag-types collapsed by 'ecb-expand-methods-nodes'.  For
     valid values of this option see 'ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec'!

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: methods-nodes-expand-spec
     Semantic tag-types expanded by 'ecb-expand-methods-nodes'.

     The value of this option is either the symbol 'all' (all tags are
     expanded regardless of their type) or a list of symbols where each
     symbol is a valid semantic tag-type.  For a description of semantic
     tag types see option 'ecb-show-tags'.

     But this option also defines if bucket-nodes in the
     ECB-method-buffer (e.g.  "[Variables]") should be expanded.
     Therefore valid symbols for this list are also all cars of the
     variable returned by 'ecb--semantic-symbol->name-assoc-list'.

     If there is a bucket-name (the node-name stripped of the settings
     in 'ecb-bucket-node-display') which is not contained as cdr in the
     value returned by 'ecb--semantic-symbol->name-assoc-list' then the
     symbol with this bucket-name as name is also a valid symbol for
     this list.  Example: In ECB there are buckets "[Parents]".  The
     bucket-name is "Parents" and the valid symbol-name is then
     'Parents'.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: methods-separate-prototypes
     Separate function-prototypes from the real functions.  This is for
     example useful for C++ and C because these languages distinct
     between a method-prototype (rsp.  function-prototype for C) and the
     method (rsp.  function for C) itself.  If this option is not nil
     then ECB separates the prototypes from the real function/methods.
     Then with 'ecb-show-tags' the user can define different
     display-settings for each of them.  If this option is nil then the
     prototypes and the real functions are filled in the same bucket and
     displayed plain and there is no sorting between prototypes and
     functions possible.  If this option is switched on then it is
     senseful that 'ecb-show-tags' contains for all modes which distinct
     between prototypes and real functions/methods two entries for the
     tag-type 'function - see the documentation of this option.

 -- User Option: post-process-semantic-taglist
     Define mode-dependent post-processing for the semantic-taglist.
     This is an alist where the car is a major-mode symbol and the cdr
     is a list of function-symbols of functions which should be used for
     post-processing the taglist (returned by
     'ecb--semantic-bovinate-toplevel') for a buffer in this major-mode.
     The first function in the list is called with current semantic
     taglist of current buffer and must return a valid taglist again.
     All other functions are called with the result-taglist of its
     preceding function and have to return a new taglist again.

     For oo-programming languages where the methods of a class can be
     defined outside the class-definition (e.g.  C++, Eieio) the
     function 'ecb-group-function-tags-with-parents' can be used to get
     a much better method-display in the methods-window of ECB, because
     all method implementations of a class are grouped together.

     Another senseful usage is to filter out certain tags, e.g.
     prototype tags in 'c-mode'.  For this you can set
     'ecb-filter-c-prototyp-tags'.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: show-only-positioned-tags
     Show only nodes in the method-buffer which are "jump-able".  If not
     nil then ECB displays in the method-buffer only nodes which are
     "jump-able", i.e.  after selecting it by clicking or with RET then
     ECB jumps to the corresponding location in the edit-window.
     Example: With CLOS or Eieio source-code there can exist some
     position-less nodes like variable-attributes in a 'defclass' form
     which are only displayed if this option is nil.  Displaying such
     nodes can be senseful even if they can not be jumped.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: show-tags
     How to show tags in the methods buffer first time after find-file.
     This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e.  for every
     major-mode a different setting can be used.  The value of this
     option is a list of cons-cells:

     The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol
     'default which means if no setting for a certain major-mode is
     defined then the cdr of the 'default cons-cell is used.  This
     option should always contain a default-setting!

     The cdr is a list where each element represents a type of tags:

          (<tag type> <display type> <sort method>)

     There can be more than 1 element for a certain <tag type>.  This is
     for example useful for C++ and C because these languages distinct
     between a method-prototype (rsp.  function-prototype for C) and the
     method (rsp.  function for C) itself.  The default value of these
     option contains two entries for <tag type> is 'function' whereas
     the first one is responsible for the "real" methods (rsp.
     functions) and the second one for the prototypes.  So if the
     methods should be flattened and the prototypes collapsed the
     show-tags-list for C++ and C must contain two entries for <tag
     type> 'function', the first one defined as 'flattened' and the
     second one defined as 'collapsed'.

     The tags in the methods buffer are displayed in the order as they
     appear in this list.

     '<tag type>'
          A Semantic tag type symbol (function, variable, rule, include
          etc.)  or one of the following:

             - 't': All tag types not specified anywhere else in the
               list.
             - 'parent': The parents of a type.

     '<display type>'
          A symbol which describes how the tags of this type shall be
          shown:

             - 'expanded': The tags are shown in an expanded node.
             - 'collapsed': The tags are shown in a collapsed node.
             - 'flattened': The tags are added to the parent node.
             - 'hidden': The tags are not shown.

     '<sort method>'
          A symbol describing how to sort the tags of this type:

             - 'name': Sort by the tag name.
             - 'access': Sort by tag access (public, protected, private)
               and then by name.
             - 'nil': Don't sort tags.  They appear in the same order as
               in the source buffer.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: tag-display-function
     Function to use for displaying tags in the methods buffer.  This
     functionality is set on major-mode base, i.e.  for every major-mode
     a different function can be used.  The value of this option is a
     list of cons-cells:

        - The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol
          'default which means if no function for a certain major-mode
          is defined then the cdr of the 'default cons-cell is used.
        - The cdr is the function used for displaying a tag in the
          related major-mode.

     Every function is called with 3 arguments:

       1. The tag
       2. The parent-tag of tag (can be nil)
       3. The value of 'ecb-font-lock-tags'.

     Every function must return the display of the tag as string,
     colorized if the third argument is not nil.

     The following functions are predefined:

        * For each element E of 'ecb--semantic-format-function-alist'
          exists a function with name "ecb-<(cdr E)>".  These functions
          are just aliase to the builtin format-functions of semantic.
          See the docstring of these functions to see what they do.
          Example: (semantic-name-nonterminal .
          semantic-format-tag-name) is an element of
          'ecb--semantic-format-function-alist'.  Therefore the
          alias-function for this element is named
          'ecb--semantic-format-tag-name'.

        * For every cdr in 'ecb--semantic-format-function-alist' with
          name "semantic-XYZ" a function with name "ecb-XYC" is
          predefined.  The differences between the semantic- and the
          ECB-version are:

             - The ECB-version displays for type tags only the type-name
               and nothing else (exception: In c++-mode a template
               specifier is appended to the type-name if a template
               instead a normal class).
             - The ECB-version displays type-tags according to the
               setting in 'ecb-type-tag-display'.  This is useful for
               better recognizing different classes, structs etc.  in
               the ECB-method window.

          For all tags which are not types the display of the
          ECB-version is identical to the semantic version.  Example:
          For 'ecb--semantic-format-tag-name' (one of the builtin
          semantic formatters) the pendant is 'ecb-format-tag-name'.

     This functionality also allows the user to display tags as UML. To
     enable this functionality set the function for a major-mode \(e.g.
     'jde-mode') to 'ecb--semantic-format-tag-uml-concise-prototype',
     'ecb--semantic-format-tag-uml-prototype', or
     'ecb--semantic-format-tag-uml-abbreviate' the ECB-versions of these
     functions.

     If the value is 'nil', i.e.  neither a function for a major-mode is
     defined nor the special 'default, then
     'ecb--semantic-format-tag-prototype' is used for displaying the
     tags.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: tag-jump-sets-mark
     Set the mark after jumping to a tag from the ECB-method buffer.  If
     set the user can easily jump back.

 -- User Option: tag-visit-post-actions
     Actions to perform after visiting a tag from the Method-buffer.
     With this option actions can be added which will be performed after
     visiting the start of the tag in the source-buffer.

     This functionality is set on a 'major-mode' base, i.e.  for every
     'major-mode' a different setting can be used.  The value of this
     option is a list of cons-cells:
        - The car is either a 'major-mode' symbol or the special symbol
          'default.

        - The cdr is a list of action-functions or nil.

     ECB first performs all actions defined for the special symbol
     'default (if any) and then all actions defined for current
     'major-mode' (if any).

     ECB offers some predefined senseful action-functions.  Currently
     there are: 'ecb-tag-visit-highlight-tag-header'
     'ecb-tag-visit-smart-tag-start' 'ecb-tag-visit-recenter'
     'ecb-tag-visit-recenter-top' 'ecb-tag-visit-goto-doc-start'
     'ecb-tag-visit-narrow-tag' See the documentation of these function
     for details what they do.

     But you can add any arbitrary function if the following conditions
     are fulfilled: The function gets the semantic tag as argument
     returns the (new) point after finishing its job.

 -- User Option: type-tag-display
     How to display semantic type-tags in the methods buffer.  Normally
     all tag displaying, colorizing and facing is done by semantic
     according to the value returned by
     'ecb--semantic-format-face-alist' and the semantic display-function
     (e.g.  one from 'ecb--semantic-format-tag-functions').  But
     sometimes a finer distinction in displaying the different type
     specifiers of type-tags can be useful.  For a description when this
     option is evaluated look at 'ecb-tag-display-function'!

     This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e.  for every
     major-mode a different setting can be used.  The value of this
     option is a list of cons-cells:

        * The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol
          'default which means if no setting for a certain major-mode is
          defined then the cdr of the 'default cons-cell is used.

        * The cdr is a list of 3-element-lists:

            1. First entry is a semantic type specifier in string-form.
               Current available type specifiers are for example
               "class", "interface", "struct", "typedef" and "enum".  In
               addition to these ones there is also a special ECB type
               specifier "group" which is related to grouping tags (see
               'ecb-post-process-semantic-taglist' and
               'ecb-group-function-tags-with-parents').  Any arbitrary
               specifier can be set here but if it is not "group" or not
               known by semantic it will be useless.
            2. Second entry is a flag which indicates if the
               type-specifier string from (1.)  itself should be removed
               (if there is any) from the display.
            3. Third entry is the face which is used in the ECB-method
               window to display type-tags with this specifier.  ECB has
               some predefined faces for this
               ('ecb-type-tag-class-face',
               'ecb-type-tag-interface-face',
               'ecb-type-tag-struct-face', 'ecb-type-tag-typedef-face',
               'ecb-type-tag-union-face', 'ecb-type-tag-enum-face' and
               'ecb-type-tag-group-face') but any arbitrary face can be
               set here.  This face is merged with the faces semantic
               already uses to display a tag, i.e.  the result is a
               display where all face-attributes of the ECB-face take
               effect plus all face-attributes of the semantic-faces
               which are not set in the ECB-face (with XEmacs this merge
               doesn't work so here the ECB-face replaces the
               semantic-faces; this may be fixed in future versions).

     The default value is nil means there is no special ECB-displaying
     of type-tags in addition to the displaying and colorizing semantic
     does.  But a value like the following could be a useful setting:

          ((default
             ("class" t ecb-type-tag-class-face)
             ("group" nil ecb-type-tag-group-face))
           (c-mode
            ("struct" nil ecb-type-tag-struct-face)
            ("typedef" nil ecb-type-tag-typedef-face)))

     This means that in 'c-mode' only "struct"s and "typedef"s are
     displayed with special faces (the specifiers itself are not
     removed) and in all other modes "class"s and grouping-tags (see
     'ecb-tag-display-function', 'ecb-group-function-tags-with-parents')
     have special faces and the "class" specifier-string is removed from
     the display.

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

 -- User Option: type-tag-expansion
     Default expansion of semantic type-tags.  Semantic groups type-tags
     in different type-specifiers.  Current available type specifiers
     are for example "class", "interface", "struct", "typedef", "union"
     and "enum".  In addition to these ones there is also a special ECB
     type-specifier "group" which is related to grouping tags (see
     'ecb-post-process-semantic-taglist').

     This option defines which type-specifiers should be expanded at
     file-open-time.  Any arbitrary specifier can be set here but if it
     is not "group" or not known by semantic it will be useless.

     This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e.  for every
     major-mode a different setting can be used.  The value of this
     option is a list of cons-cells:

        * The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol
          'default' which means if no setting for a certain major-mode
          is defined then the cdr of the 'default' cons-cell is used.

        * The cdr is either a list of type-specifiers which should be
          expanded at file-open-time or the symbol 'all-specifiers'
          (then a type-tag is always expanded regardless of its
          type-specifier).

     This options takes only effect for semantic-sources - means sources
     supported by semantic!

5.3.6 Group ecb-history
-----------------------

This group contains settings for the history-buffer in the ECB:

 -- User Option: history-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running after the creation of the history-buffer.  Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating the history-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map.  So for
     example a function could be added which performs calls of
     'local-set-key' to define new keybindings only for the
     history-buffer of ECB.

 -- User Option: history-buffer-name
     Name of the ECB history buffer.  Because it is not a normal buffer
     for editing you should enclose the name with stars, e.g.  "*ECB
     History*".

     If it is necessary for you you can get emacs-lisp access to the
     buffer-object of the ECB-history-buffer by this name, e.g.  by a
     call of 'set-buffer'.

     Changes for this option at runtime will take affect only after
     deactivating and then activating ECB again!

 -- User Option: history-item-name
     The name to use for items in the history buffer.

 -- User Option: history-menu-sorter
     Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

     If a function then this function is called to sort the menu-entries
     of the combined menu-entries of the user-menu-extensions of
     'ecb-history-menu-user-extension' and the built-in-menu
     'ecb-history-menu'.  If nil then no special sorting will be done
     and the user-extensions are placed in front of the
     built-in-entries.

     For the guidelines for such a sorter-function see
     'ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: history-menu-user-extension
     Static user extensions for the popup-menu of the history buffer.
     For further explanations see 'ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'.

     The node-argument of a menu-function contains as data the filename
     of the source for which the popup-menu has been opened.

     Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning
     of the built-in menu-entries of 'ecb-history-menu' but the whole
     menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-history-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: history-menu-user-extension-function
     Dynamic user extensions for the popup-menu of the history buffer.
     A function which has to return a list in the same format like the
     option 'ecb-history-menu-user-extension'.  This function is called
     when the user opens the popup-menu for the history buffer.

     Per default the dynamic user-extensions are added in front of the
     static extensions of 'ecb-history-menu-user-extension' but the
     whole menu can be re-arranged with 'ecb-history-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: kill-buffer-clears-history
     Define if 'kill-buffer' should also clear the history.  There are
     three options:

        - 'auto': Removes automatically the corresponding history-entry
          after the buffer has been killed.
        - 'ask': Asks, if the history-entry should be removed after the
          kill.
        - 'nil': 'kill-buffer' does not affect the history (this is the
          default).

 -- User Option: sort-history-items
     Sorts the items in the history buffer.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ecb-layout,  Next: ecb-compilation,  Prev: ecb-history,  Up: Customizable options

5.3.7 Group ecb-layout
----------------------

This group contains settings for the screen-layout of the ECB:

 -- User Option: activate-before-new-frame-created-hook
     Normal hook run before the new ECB-frame is created if
     'ecb-new-ecb-frame' is not nil (otherwise this hook is not
     evaluated).

 -- User Option: advice-window-functions
     Advice functions to be more intelligent if used with ECB. You can
     choose the following functions to be adviced by ECB so they behave
     as if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the only windows(s) of the
     ECB-frame:

        * 'other-window' For this one see also the option
          'ecb-other-window-behavior'!
        * 'delete-window'
        * 'delete-other-windows'
        * 'delete-windows-on'
        * 'split-window-horizontally'
        * 'split-window-vertically'
        * 'split-window' If this advice is enabled then
          'split-window-vertically' and 'split-window-horizontally' are
          autom.  enabled too!
        * 'switch-to-buffer'
        * 'switch-to-buffer-other-window'
        * 'display-buffer' Especially if 'ecb-compile-window-height' is
          not nil it is strongly recommended not to disable this advice!
        * 'other-window-for-scrolling' If this advice is enabled then
          the behavior of the following functions depends on
          'ecb-other-window-behavior':
             - 'scroll-other-window'
             - 'scroll-other-window-down'
             - 'beginning-of-buffer-other-window'
             - 'end-of-buffer-other-window'
        * 'balance-windows': Only the edit-windows are balanced

     For working most conveniently with ECB it is the best to advice all
     these functions, because then all the standard shortcuts of these
     functions are also usable with ECB without doing anything else.
     Also other packages can interact best with ECB if these functions
     are all adviced.  If these adviced functions are called in another
     frame than the ECB-frame they behave all exactly like the not
     adviced versions!

     But please read also the following:

     Normally all packages should work correct with ECB and its adviced
     functions but if there occur problems with a package cause of some
     of these adviced functions ECB offers the following fall-back
     solution:

       1. Deactivate in 'ecb-advice-window-functions' all the
          adviced-functions which make problems with other packages.
       2. For every of the advice-able functions <adv-func> ECB offers a
          interactively function named "ecb-<adv-func>" which does
          exactly the same as the adviced version of <adv-func>.  Use
          "ecb-<adv-func>" instead the original one to get the proper
          ECB behavior even if the function is not adviced anymore.
       3. You can bind in 'ecb-activate-hook' the standard-shortcut of
          <adv-func> to "ecb-<adv-func>" and rebind it in
          'ecb-deactivate-hook' to <adv-func>.
       4. Now you have the best of both worlds: The problematic package
          works and you have the ECB-behavior of <adv-func> as if it
          would be adviced.

     Here is an example: Suppose you must deactivating the advice for
     'switch-to-buffer-other-window'.  Then you deactivate this function
     with this option and you can use
     'ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' instead.  Bind the shortcut you
     normally use for 'switch-to-buffer-other-window' to
     'ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' (use 'ecb-activate-hook' for
     this) and rebind it to the original function in the
     'ecb-deactivate-hook'.

 -- User Option: advice-window-functions-signal-error
     Signal an error if an adviced function can not do its job.  If not
     nil then an error is signaled if one of the adviced functions (see
     'ecb-advice-window-functions') can not do its job.  So for example
     if the user tries to split the compile-window or an ecb-tree-window
     or if one tries to switch to another buffer in one of the
     ecb-tree-windows.  For details see the documentation of each of the
     adviced functions to get info when an error is signaled.

     If this option is nil then no error is signaled but the called
     adviced function does simply nothing.

     Default is nil but it can also be useful to signal errors - so you
     see when call a function in a situation which is not supported by
     this function.

 -- User Option: fix-window-size
     Fix size of the ECB-windows/buffers even after frame-resizing.  The
     fix type (valid values are nil, t, width and height) can either be
     set on a layout-basis (means a different value for each layout) or
     one value can be set for all layouts.

     For a detailed description of the valid values see description of
     'window-size-fixed' which is newly introduced in GNU Emacs 21 and
     is only available there.  Therefore this option takes only effect
     with GNU Emacs 21.

     Note1: Manually resizing the ECB-windows via 'enlarge-window',
     'shrink-window', 'mouse-drag-vertical-line' and
     'mouse-drag-mode-line' is still possible even if the window-sizes
     are fixed for frame-resizing!

     Note2: The description of 'window-size-fixed' in the
     Elisp-info-manual is more detailed than the description offered by
     'C-h v'!

     Note3: With current Emacs 21.2.X there seems to be no distinction
     between 'width', 'height' and 't'.  Therefore this option takes no
     effect (means all ecb-windows have always unfixed sizes) if
     'ecb-compile-window-height' is not 'nil'.

     Per default no window-size fixing has been done.

 -- User Option: hide-ecb-windows-after-hook
     Hooks run direct after the ECB windows have been hidden.  Hiding
     was done either by 'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' or
     'ecb-hide-ecb-windows'.

     IMPORTANT: Hiding the ECB-windows is internally done by calling
     'ecb-redraw-layout' and therefore also the hooks
     'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook' and 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
     are evaluated.  The hook-sequence is analogous to that described in
     'ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook'.

 -- User Option: hide-ecb-windows-before-hook
     Hook run direct before the ECB windows will be hidden.  Hiding is
     done either by 'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' or 'ecb-hide-ecb-windows'.
     This means that at runtime of this hook all the ECB-tree-windows of
     current layout are visible.

     IMPORTANT: Hiding the ECB-windows is internally done by calling
     'ecb-redraw-layout' and therefore also the hooks
     'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook' and 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
     are evaluated.  The hook-sequence is analogous to that described in
     'ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook'.

 -- User Option: ignore-display-buffer-function
     Adviced 'display-buffer' ignores 'display-buffer-function'.  This
     means, that the adviced version of 'display-buffer' (see
     'ecb-advice-window-functions') ignores the value of
     'display-buffer-function' when called for the 'ecb-frame'.  If this
     variable should not be ignored then the function of
     'display-buffer-function' is completely responsible which window is
     used for the buffer to display - no smart ECB-logic will help to
     deal best with the ECB-window-layout!  You can define if and when
     'display-buffer-function' should be ignored:

        - only when durable compile window is used - i.e.  if
          'ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil

        - always when ECB is active - that means ignore when ECB is
          active otherwise not - this is the default value

        - never, the adviced version of 'display-buffer' always uses the
          value of 'display-buffer-function' if the value is a function.

 -- User Option: ignore-special-display
     Ignore special-display-handling.  This means, that all values of
     'special-display-function', 'special-display-buffer-names' and
     'special-display-regexps' are ignored

        * only when durable compile window is used - i.e.  if
          'ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil - this is the default
          value.

        * always when ECB is active - that means no
          special-display-handling of buffers when ECB is active

        * never, i.e.  special-dislay-handling depends on the values of
          the options 'special-display-function',
          'special-display-buffer-names' and 'special-display-regexps'.

 -- User Option: layout-always-operate-in-edit-window
     Adviced window functions work always in the edit-window.  If we are
     in an ECB special buffer (methods, directories, etc), and any of
     the adviced windowing functions is called interactively (see
     'ecb-advice-window-functions'), we will select first an edit-window
     according to the value of 'ecb-mouse-click-destination'.  This is
     useful if you have any functions that use such functions and you
     don't want them to fail with an error complaining that the current
     buffer can not be split, or something similar.

     Because this may not be desirable in all situations and for all
     adviced functions this can be enabled separately for every
     advicable function (see also 'ecb-advice-window-functions').  If
     the symbol of an adviced function is contained in the value of this
     option, then a edit-window is first selected otherwise either an
     error is reported or some other special reaction (depends on
     'ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'); see the documentation
     of the adviced functions for this.

     For 'other-window', 'other-window-for-scrolling' and
     'switch-to-buffer-other-window' this makes no sense, therefore you
     can not enable this for them.

     Per default this is enabled for 'switch-to-buffer' and
     'display-buffer'.

 -- User Option: layout-debug-mode
     Write debug-information about layout-operations in the
     Messages-buffer.  Normally there should be no need to set this
     option to true but if there are problems to display buffers in the
     compile-window of ECB (e.g.  buffers which should be displayed
     there aren't or the temporally enlarging-mechanism does not do what
     you think it should do etc...)  then please do the following steps:

       1. Set 'ecb-layout-debug-mode' to not nil

       2. Reproduce the wrong behavior exactly by repeating all the
          operations which lead to the problem.

       3. Now send immediately a bug report with
          'ecb-submit-problem-report'.

       4. Set 'ecb-layout-debug-mode' back to nil if you do not want
          further debugging output in the *Messages* buffer

 -- User Option: layout-name
     Select a window layout of ECB. Value is any arbitrary string.
     There are four different types of layouts: left, right, top and
     left-right, which means the location of the ECB-tree-windows in the
     ECB-frame.  Currently there are 20 predefined layouts; names see
     below.  You can savely try out any of them by changing this value
     and saving it only for the current session.  If you are sure which
     layout you want you can save it for future sessions.  To get a
     picture of the layout for name <name> call 'ecb-show-layout-help'.
     'ecb-layout-function-9'.

     Currently available layouts:

        * Left layouts: left1 left2 left3 left4 left5 left6 left7 left8
          left9 left10 left11 left12 left13 left14 left15

        * Right layouts: right1

        * Top layouts: top1 top2

        * Left-right layouts: leftright1 leftright2

     Regardless of the settings you define here: If you have destroyed
     or changed the ECB-screen-layout by any action you can always go
     back to this layout with 'ecb-redraw-layout'

 -- User Option: layout-window-sizes
     Specifies the sizes of the ECB windows for each layout.  The
     easiest way (and also the strongly recommended way) to change this
     variable is to change the window sizes by dragging the window
     borders using the mouse and then store the window sizes by calling
     the command 'ecb-store-window-sizes'.  Next time the layout is
     redrawn the values stored in this option will be used.

     If 'ecb-store-window-sizes' is used then the windows sizes are
     stored per default as fractions of current frame-width and -height
     of the ecb-frame, so the stored values will "work" for other frame
     sizes too.  But if you call 'ecb-store-window-sizes' with a
     prefix-argument then the fixed values of current width and height
     are stored!

     If this option is set "by hand" (i.e.  not by
     'ecb-store-window-sizes') then the following is important:
        - It is recommended to use fractions of frame-width and
          -height!.
        - The order of the sequence of the inserted window sizes must be
          the same as 'other-window' (the not-adviced version!)  would
          walk!

 -- User Option: maximize-ecb-window-after-selection
     If not nil maximize current tree-window after selection.  When
     selecting another not-tree-window after such an automatic
     maximizing all tree-windows of current layout are displayed again.
     But a tree-window is not maximized if either a node has been
     selected via primary- oder secondarc mouse-button or the popup-menu
     of that tree-buffer has been opened.

 -- User Option: new-ecb-frame
     Create a new frame at activation time of ECB.

 -- User Option: other-window-behavior
     The behavior of ECB concerning getting an "other window".  This has
     an effect if either 'other-window' or 'other-window-for-scrolling'
     is adviced by ECB, see 'ecb-advice-window-functions'.  The
     following settings are possible:

     'all':

     ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll
     simply the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the
     original 'other-window' rsp.  the original
     'other-window-for-scrolling'.

     'only-edit':

     ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only scroll
     another edit-window.  If the selected window is not an edit-window
     then it behaves like with value 'all'.

     'edit-and-compile':

     Like 'only-edit' plus the compile window if any.  If the selected
     window is neither an edit-window nor the compile-window then it
     behaves like with value 'all'.

     'smart':

     With this setting ECB tries to choose the
     'other-window'-destination or the "other window" to scroll in a
     smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of the edit-windows and
     if the edit-area is splitted then always the "next" edit-window is
     choosen (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is
     the first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
     compile-window is used if there is one.  In the context of an
     'other-window'-call the ARG of 'other-window' will be taken into
     account.

     If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the
     "next" ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the
     last ecb-window is the first ecb-window).  In the context of an
     'other-window'-call the ARG of 'other-window' will be taken into
     account.

     If the compile-window is selected then always the last edit-window
     which had the point will be used unless 'other-window' has been
     called with a prefix-argument unequal 1.

     If there is an active minibuffer:

     Regardless of the allowed values above ECB handles the situation of
     an active minibuffer during a call to 'other-window' or
     'scroll-other-window' like follows:

     If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the
     window 'minibuffer-scroll-window' points to (when this variable is
     set, otherwise the compile-window or the last selected edit-window
     is choosen) when the called command is called to choose the 1.
     next window (always true for scrolling another window or true when
     'other-window' called without prefix-arg or with prefix-arg equal
     1).  Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen (in case of
     'other-window').

     If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not
     selected then 'other-window' and 'scroll-other-window' behave like
     the original version.

     In addition to the allowed values above the value of this option
     can also be a function:

     A function:

     This function gets seven arguments:
       1. A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the
          'ecb-frame'
       2. A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
       3. A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
       4. The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.
       5. The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active
          minibuffer.
       6. The result of the function 'ecb-where-is-point' - see the
          documentation of this function for details.
       7. An integer which indicates how many steps away from the
          current selected window the "other-window" is.  Is nil when
          this function is called in another context then for
          'other-window'.

     The function has to return a window-object which is then used as
     "other window" for the command 'other-window' or for scrolling
     another window (e.g.  with 'scroll-other-window').  Such a function
     has to handle properly all situation for itself.
     'ecb-get-other-window-smart' is an example for such a function.

 -- User Option: redraw-layout-after-hook
     Hooks run direct before the ECB windows will be shown either by
     'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' or 'ecb-show-ecb-windows'.  This means
     that at runtime of this hook the ECB-windows are already visible.

 -- User Option: redraw-layout-before-hook
     Hooks run direct before the ECB-layout will be redrawn by either
     'ecb-redraw-layout'.

 -- User Option: redraw-layout-quickly
     If non-nil, we will attempt to redraw the layout quickly.  Please
     read also carefully the documentation of 'ecb-redraw-layout'.

 -- User Option: select-edit-window-on-redraw
     Select the first edit window on 'ecb-redraw-layout'.

 -- User Option: show-ecb-windows-after-hook
     Hooks run direct before the ECB windows will be shown either by
     'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' or 'ecb-show-ecb-windows'.  This means
     that at runtime of this hook the ECB-windows are already visible.

     IMPORTANT: Showing the hidden ECB-windows is internally done by
     calling 'ecb-redraw-layout' and therefore also the hooks
     'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook' and 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
     are evaluated.  So there is the following sequence of hooks during
     the process of showing the hidden ECB-windows:
       1. 'ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook'
       2. 'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'
       3. <redrawing the layout to show the hidden ECB-windows>
       4. 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
       5. 'ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook'
     So be aware which code you add to which hook!

 -- User Option: show-ecb-windows-before-hook
     Hooks run direct before the ECB windows will be shown either by
     'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' or 'ecb-show-ecb-windows'.  This means
     that at runtime of this hook the ECB-windows are still hidden.

     IMPORTANT: Showing the hidden ECB-windows is internally done by
     calling 'ecb-redraw-layout' and therefore also the hooks
     'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook' and 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
     are evaluated.  So there is the following sequence of hooks during
     the process of showing the hidden ECB-windows:
       1. 'ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook'
       2. 'ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'
       3. <redrawing the layout to show the hidden ECB-windows>
       4. 'ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'
       5. 'ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook'
     So be aware which code you add to which hook!

 -- User Option: split-edit-window-after-start
     Sets if and how the edit window should be splitted after ECB-start.
     But be aware: This option determines only if and how the
     edit-window should be splitted at start-time of ECB. There are five
     different values allowed for this option:

        - 'nil': Do not split the edit-area of ECB after activation,
          i.e.  there will be only one edit-window after starting ECB.

        - 'horizontal': Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows side by
          side.

        - 'vertical': Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows, one above
          the other.

        - 'before-activation': Split the edit-area as before the
          ECB-start, i.e.  the edit-area will have after start a
          window-layout as the whole frame had before the start of ECB.

        - 'before-deactivation': Split the edit-area into a
          window-layout ECB had in its edit-area direct before the
          ECB-deactivation.  This value preserves the full state between
          activations of ECB, i.e.  the visibility of the ECB-windows,
          the visibility of a compile-window and also the full
          split-state of the edit-area.  But this can only be done if
          important layout-options have not been changed in the
          meanwhile.  These are the options 'ecb-layout-name',
          'ecb-compile-window-height', 'ecb-compile-window-width',
          'ecb-windows-width' and 'ecb-windows-height'.

     Default value is 'before-deactivation'.

     Some remarks to the value 'before-activation': If this value has
     been set then ECB needs three permanent adivces even when ECB is
     deactivated: 'split-window', 'delete-window' and
     'delete-other-windows'.  But these advices do not change any
     behavior of these functions but only storing in an internal
     ECB-variable the facts that a window has been splitted or deleted.
     In addition to this these advices are 100% error-save, means the
     functionality of the original functions will be performed in
     every(!)  case even if within the advice an error occurs (but
     normally there can no errors occur in these advices because they
     are very simple).  Conclusion: If you want really all ECB-advices
     being disabled after deactivating ECB then you have to set this
     option to other values then 'before-activation'.  But setting this
     variable to this value is really completely save.

 -- User Option: toggle-layout-sequence
     Toggle sequence for layout toggling with 'ecb-toggle-layout'.
     Every element of this list has to be a valid layout-name i.e.
     either one of the predefined layouts or one of the user-defined
     layouts.

     You can add here as many layouts as you want but to use this option
     most effective you should not add more than 2 or 3 layouts so every
     layout can be accessed very fast by toggling with
     'ecb-toggle-layout'.  It is also senseful to add layouts which have
     the same principal outline, i.e.  all their tree-buffers are on the
     same side of the frame and the tree-buffer-"column" (or -"row") has
     identical size for the layouts.

     Recommended values are for example:

        - ("left10" "left15"), toggles between methods and
          directories/history
        - ("left10" "left13"), toggles between methods and directories
        - ("left10" "left14"), toggles between methods and history
        - ("left10" "left13" "left14"), toggles between methods, history
          and directories

     See also option 'ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer'.

     This option makes only sense if the value is a list with more than
     1 element!

 -- User Option: windows-height
     The height of the ECB windows in lines for top-layouts.  If the
     number is less than 1.0 the width is a fraction of the frame
     height.

 -- User Option: windows-width
     The width of the ECB windows in columns for left- and right
     layouts.  If the number is less than 1.0 the width is a fraction of
     the frame width.

5.3.8 Group ecb-compilation
---------------------------

This group contains settings for the compile window of ECB:

 -- User Option: compilation-buffer-names
     Additional buffer names that should be displayed in the
     compile-window.  Buffer names can either be defined as strings or
     as regexps.  If the buffer-name of a buffer matches one of the
     defined string or regexp then it will be displayed in the
     compile-window of ECB even if 'compilation-buffer-p' says nil for
     this buffer.

     It is not recommended to add the eshell-buffer-names to this list
     because ECB already handles the eshell-integration as best as
     possible (*note Using eshell::).

     See also the options 'ecb-compilation-major-modes' and
     'ecb-compilation-predicates'.

 -- User Option: compilation-major-modes
     Additional major-mode that should be displayed in the
     compile-window.  All buffers of a major-mode contained in this list
     are displayed in the compile-window even if 'compilation-buffer-p'
     says nil for such a buffer.

     It is not recommended to add 'eshell-mode' to this list because ECB
     already handles the eshell-integration as best as possible (*note
     Using eshell::).

 -- User Option: compilation-predicates
     Predicates when a buffer should be treated as compilation-buffer.
     Every element of this list has to be a function or
     lambda-expression which gets as argument a buffer-object and which
     has to return not nil when this buffer should be treated as
     compilation-buffer (even if 'compilation-buffer-p' says nil) and
     therefore be displayed in the compile-window of ECB (if there is
     any).

     In combination with the values of 'ecb-compilation-buffer-names'
     and 'ecb-compilation-major-modes' ECB decides when a buffer is
     displayed in the compile-window.

     Default value is the function 'comint-check-proc' which returns not
     nil when the buffer is related to a living process.

 -- User Option: compile-window-height
     Height of the durable compilation-window of ECB. If you want a
     compilation window shown at the bottom of the ECB-layout then set
     here the height of it (Default is a height of 5).  If you redraw
     the current layout with 'ecb-redraw-layout' then the compilation
     window (if any) has the height you set here.  If the number is less
     than 1.0 the height is a fraction of the frame height.

     If you do not set a durable compilation window then doing a
     compilation or displaying temp-buffers (e.g.  *Help*-buffers)
     splits temporally the edit window vertically if the edit window is
     not splitted already or uses another edit window temporally for
     compilation output if the edit window is already splitted.  This is
     the recommended value for this option because this is the
     standard-behavior of Emacs.

     Beware: If you set a durable compilation window then ECB displays
     all buffers for which 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil in
     that durable compilation window.  If a buffer which should being
     displayed there is not displayed there then try to modify the
     options 'ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
     'ecb-compilation-major-modes' or 'ecb-compilation-predicates' (in
     this sequence).

     See also the options 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' and
     'ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height' and also the command
     'ecb-toggle-compile-window-height'!

     ECB offers the functionality of such a durable compile-window
     regardless if the special ECB-windows are visible or not (see the
     command 'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows').

     Regardless of the settings you define here: If you have destroyed
     or changed the ECB-screen-layout by any action you can always go
     back to this layout with 'ecb-redraw-layout'

 -- User Option: compile-window-prevent-shrink-below-height
     Allow the compile-window to be shrunken below its height.  A non
     nil value means ECB prevents the compile-window from being shrunken
     below the threshold of 'ecb-compile-window-height' by displaying
     temp-buffers (e.g.  *Help* etc.)  or after running compilations or
     greps.  But interactively it is always allowed to shrink it to
     every height!

     If nil then ECB does nothing to prevent being shrunken below the
     value of 'ecb-compile-window-height'.

     Default is t.

 -- User Option: compile-window-temporally-enlarge
     Let Emacs temporally enlarge the compile-window of the ECB-layout.
     This option has only an effect if 'ecb-compile-window-height' is
     not nil!

     The following values are possible:
        - 'after-display': After displaying a "compilation-buffer" (in
          the sense of 'ecb-compilation-buffer-p'!)  in the
          compile-window of ECB. For the max.  height of the enlarged
          compile-window see the option
          'ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height'.

        - 'after-selection': Selecting the 'ecb-compile-window' auto.
          enlarges it and de-selecting (means leaving
          'ecb-compile-window') auto.  shrinks it.  Enlarging and
          shrinking the 'ecb-compile-window' is done with
          'ecb-toggle-compile-window-height'.  See also the
          documentation of this function!

        - 'both': The combination of 'after-display and
          'after-selection.

        - 'nil': ECB fixes always the height of the 'ecb-compile-window'
          at the value of 'ecb-compile-window-height'.

     To restore the ECB-layout after such a buffer-enlarge just call
     'ecb-toggle-compile-window-height' or 'ecb-redraw-layout'.

 -- User Option: compile-window-width
     Width of the compile-window.

     Possible values are 'frame' and 'edit-window'.  With 'frame' the
     compile-window looks like:

             -------------------------------------------------------

             -------------------------------------------------------

     With 'edit-window' the compile-window looks like:

             -------------------------------------------------------
             |              |                                      |

             -------------------------------------------------------

     This option takes only effect if 'ecb-compile-window-height' is not
     nil!

 -- User Option: change-layout-preserves-compwin-state
     Changing the layout preserves the state of the compile-window.
     This is for example useful if the user toggles between several
     layouts (see 'ecb-toggle-layout') and wants to preserve the
     hidden-state of the compile-window.

 -- User Option: enlarged-compilation-window-max-height
     The max height of the compile-window after enlarging it.  The max
     height of the compilation window after enlarged by
     'ecb-toggle-compile-window-height'.  The following values are
     allowed:

     'best':

     ECB fits the height of the compile-window exactly to the size of
     its current contents but never shrinks below the value of
     'ecb-compile-window-height' or enlarges over the half of the
     frame-height of the ECB-frame.  The values of the options
     'compilation-window-height' and 'temp-buffer-max-height' are taken
     into account dependent of the current 'major-mode' of the buffer in
     the compile-window: If 'compilation-mode' then
     'compilation-window-height' is used otherwise
     'temp-buffer-max-height'.

     'half':

     1/2 the frame-height of the ECB-frame

     Any number:

     Max height in lines.  If the number is less than 1.0 the height is
     a fraction of the frame height (e.g.  0.33 results in a max-height
     of 1/3 the frame-height).

 -- User Option: scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile-window
     'scroll-other-window' scrolls always the compile-window.  For all
     details about the scroll-behavior of 'scroll-other-window' see the
     advice documentation of 'other-window-for-scrolling'.
